**UPDATE 2023-SEP-05:**   
*Any responses before line 3429 did not have these updates.*

* Added a column for ""year salary was applicable"": You can put a single year or a range of years. Answer is limited to only 9 characters in hopes that there will only be numerical values and the dash, ex: 1989-2023. It is optional as it is implied that the salary added is the salary received in the year of the timestamp.
* Added data rules to salary: It is now only limited to numbers so no symbols can be added and no varying answers.
* Added ""salary comments"" in case anyone wanted to elaborate on their salary. It is optional.
* Column A is now unhid, but small so you still need to expand it. This is for the timestamp.

I made a Google form that we can all fill out anonymously about our role and salary. u/snoopypoo31's recent post is what initiated the creation. I based it off responses from their thread, from my colleagues’ suggestions, & from the [original media spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11obKJpckWJNyEYPdhHM0iaGp0x4QoVk_7aitRC5zVlc/edit#gid=70710369) I had previously mentioned.

**UPDATE 2023-SEP-05:**   
*Any responses before line 3429 did not have these updates.*

* Added a column for ""year salary was applicable"": You can put a single year or a range of years. Answer is limited to only 9 characters in hopes that there will only be numerical values and the dash, ex: 1989-2023. It is optional as it is implied that the salary added is the salary received in the year of the timestamp.
* Added data rules to salary: It is now only limited to numbers so no symbols can be added and no varying answers.
* Added ""salary comments"" in case anyone wanted to elaborate on their salary. It is optional.
* Column A is now unhid, but small so you still need to expand it. This is for the timestamp.

I made a Google form that we can all fill out anonymously about our role and salary. u/snoopypoo31's recent post is what initiated the creation.

About papers he said that we are not ready to write anything yet. 

What should I make of this ? Is this pretty common in academic research?

I won't get paid during this time. He asked me to quit my other job which was benefitted and more stable to come work full time with him. And now this!
