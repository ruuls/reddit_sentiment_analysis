It's a *very* interesting account of one OCD patient in an ongoing trial, and will give you insight into how psilocybin might be working in OCD on a psychological level. The intro & discussion of that case study also summarize the existing work on psilocybin in OCD (less thoroughly than this review, but possibly better written). No big new information has come out since then. There are six clinical trials currently underway; the only completed clinical trial [was in 2009 and included 9 patients](https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/safety-tolerability-efficacy-psilocybin-patients-obsessive/).

Not related to psilocybin: this review discusses early maladaptive schemas as part of the ""etiology"" of OCD-- that's unusual. I've seen EMSs discussed w/r/t OCD but never as an *etiological* factor. EMSs are also not something developed to describe OCD, which the review might imply-- OCD correlates with all 18 of them, but they aren't particularly specific to the disorder. Schema therapy for OCD also has [preliminary evidence but serious methodological issues](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34296767/) and again its efficacy may be more pan-psychiatric than disorder-specific. So starting the etiology section off with this is wacky to me.",4.62863165140152

Edit: corrected to US.


“A new study highlights significant regional disparities in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias across the US, suggesting that access to necessary diagnoses for new treatments may depend on geographic location. The research, conducted by a team from the University of Michigan, analysed data from 4.8 million Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 and older in 2019.

Key findings include:

The percentage of individuals receiving a new dementia diagnosis varies widely by region, with younger adults (ages 66 to 74) and Black or Hispanic individuals experiencing even greater disparities.

A person’s chance of receiving a dementia diagnosis can be twice as high in some areas compared to others, indicating that health system factors may play a more significant role than individual risk factors.

The study found that the differences in diagnosis rates are not explained by variations in dementia risk levels among populations, but rather by “diagnostic intensity,” which reflects how actively dementia is diagnosed in different regions.

The prevalence of diagnosed dementia ranged from 4% to 14% across various hospital referral regions, with new diagnosis rates between 1.7% and 5.4%.

The findings suggest that variations in clinical practices, cultural attitudes towards seeking care, and the availability of specialists may contribute to these disparities.

The study calls for targeted efforts to improve diagnosis rates, particularly in areas with lower-than-expected rates, and emphasises the importance of early identification of cognitive issues. It also encourages individuals to advocate for their health needs, including cognitive screenings covered by Medicare. The recent launch of Medicare’s GUIDE model for dementia care may provide a framework for enhancing care coordination and access to trained providers.”",4.905791938304901

Also known as AFib or AF, atrial fibrillation is the most common form of arrhythmia – an abnormal heart rhythm.  It can lead to stroke, heart failure or other cardiovascular complications. More than 12 million people are projected to have AFib in the United States by 2030, according to the American Heart Association’s 2024 heart disease and stroke statistics.

Previous research linked high job strain and effort-reward imbalance at work with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. This research is the first to examine the adverse effect of both psychosocial stressors at work on atrial fibrillation, said the study’s senior author Xavier Trudel, Ph.D., an occupational and cardiovascular epidemiologist and associate professor at Laval University in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.

“Our study suggests that work-related stressors may be relevant factors to include in preventive strategies,” Trudel said. “Recognizing and addressing psychosocial stressors at work are required to foster healthy work environments that benefit both individuals and the organizations where they work.”

The device, which the researchers call ""iSOS"", has not been tested in humans, but was able to successfully revive 24 out of 25 overdosed pigs within 3.2 minutes. Opioid overdose from both prescription and illicit drugs can cause permanent brain damage within three minutes and death within four to six minutes. 

Naloxone is an effective treatment for opioid overdose, but it usually requires a bystander to step in and administer it because the person with the overdose is likely to lose consciousness. The implant continuously monitors the users respiratory rate, heart rate, body temperature, and blood oxygen saturation and uses this data in an algorithm to determine if an overdose is occurring. Going forward, the researchers plan to continue to optimise and miniaturise the device, which currently measures 8mm x 12mm x 78mm.",4.812142550945282

Researchers at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King’s College London and City University of New York tested the relative associations of court-documented exposure to, and adult recall of, childhood maltreatment with cognitive abilities within the same individuals. 1179 participants were identified from an ongoing cohort in the USA. All participants underwent a variety of tests in order to assess their cognitive abilities in adult life.

Researchers found that participants with official records of childhood maltreatment showed, on average, cognitive deficits across most tests undertaken compared to those without records. In contrast, the participants who retrospectively self-reported maltreatment did not demonstrate deficits when compared with those without reports.

The study wasn't based on diagnoses, but whether there was a documented *legal case* of abuse. That tells me that maltreatment to the extent that there's a court case opened is so bad that it causes cognitive decline in the child. Which makes sense, given the severity of the abuse cases that make it to court: you need lots of physical evidence for a court case to succeed like several broken bones, repeated photos of battery from the hospital, severe ""accidents"" that only happen when the child is with one parent, etc. 


Emotional abuse and some types of neglect are difficult to prove because of a lack of physical evidence, and so court cases are rare for that kind of abuse. Those would have been deemed self-reported instead of the court-proven cases. 



This means that certain types of abuses cause more obviously severe *cognitive* outcomes than others; it doesn't mean that the other kinds of abuse aren't that bad, or don't cause would-be Einsteins to become average Joes, which would also be difficult to prove.

I just recently joined the sub-reddit, and I've been more of a casual browser on Reddit than an active user. But I reach out to you today, because as a member of this channel I'm sure we all share at least one common interest, and that's Clinical Trials. 

I myself am based out of Tokyo, and am a rookie in the field, but I am really motivated and impassioned about the topic!

My objective is simple. With people being a little more in tune with clinical trial information (COVID pushing it into the public eye and radar a lot more), I feel like this is an ideal time to make some information accessible. I'm not talking about fantastic 3 hour seminars on YouTube that industry professionals would enjoy. I'm thinking a little more PR, layman, pop-science access to the massive mountain of information and complexity that is clinical trials.  It be cool to have non-corporate・non-PR industry perspectives, or fire side chat, or dialogue, or breakdowns for people to share. 

Part of it has been planning and thinking about what people would like, or what may be easier to create, who to best reach out to, but it's been wasting valuable time. The best thing is to just start something and get the ball rolling. Hence this post to you guys (and gals) in the hopes of starting a thread of ideas, or topics, opinions, or even dissent about this idea.

It will be monitored under real conditions of use to detect rare side effects or late complications. It can therefore be withdrawn from the market at any time. Among the many molecules tested, those concerning oncology occupy a prominent place. In this field, Canada is also participating in almost one in five trials initiated around the world.

  
**Cancer: the hope of clinical trials**

  
In Villejuif, in the Paris region, the Gustave Roussy Institute is a major center with numerous clinical trials that advance cancer research.  
Patients included in a research protocol must first sign a consent form. This document provides, among other things, informed information on the product tested, the precise course of the test and the risks of side effects.  
For the PEMBIB clinical trial, the patient first takes a blood test and an electrocardiogram. 

The results are transmitted after a few hours and if the parameters are good, the patient can receive the drug. It is tested on different types of cancers resistant to conventional care and even to some advanced treatments like immunotherapy.

  
""Immunotherapies have transformed some cancerous diseases. But unfortunately, not for a majority of patients. The current challenge is to try to make sure that some patients who do not respond to these immunotherapies alone can respond with the combination of two treatments, "". The first treatment removes the blood vessels of the tumor to allow the second treatment to penetrate better into the heart of the tumor area in order to optimize the effect of immunotherapy.

  
Nearly 70 patients participate in this research protocol. And it is thanks to these numerous clinical trials that the Gustave Roussy Institute has contributed to the development of advanced treatment in oncology: ""There are pathologies where there is therapeutic progress to be made because they are difficult to understand and to understand like cancer of the pancreas, cancer of the brain ... But by better understanding these tumors in the coming years, we will continue to progress, ""says Professor Gilles Vassal, director of clinical research.

  
Every year, more than 3,000 patients participate in clinical trials at [Clinical Research & CRO Companies Canada](https://www.biopharmaservices.com/). The Institute remains the leading center for the fight against cancer on a European scale.

  
**Epidermolysis bullosa: a life-changing clinical trial**

  
The other area very concerned by clinical trials is that of rare diseases. 95% of those affected are wandering therapeutically and only 300 curative treatments are available for 8,000 patients affected by a rare disease. These clinical trials are therefore very important.

  
The epidermolysis bullosa affects about 10,000 people in Canada, causes sores, extremely painful skin abrasions. Some forms of the disease also affect the inside of the mouth but also the esophagus, sometimes causing its narrowing with a deadly risk. Patients are currently testing an ointment in a clinical trial.

  
For this clinical trial, patients receive a daily visit from a nurse who applies the treatment and carries out the care. The mode of action of the cream remains confidential but its effects are very visible. The laboratory plans to include 80 patients in the nine countries involved in the two-year clinical trial.

  
Sick or healthy, anyone can be asked to participate in a clinical trial. This proposal can occur during a consultation with the doctor, but also by an announcement in the media. You can also volunteer independently, by contacting structures dedicated to clinical research, such as Inserm's clinical investigation centers (CIC) for example.",,,,,4.680865049362183
d61idj,clinicaltrials,Types and phases of clinical trials,gafaind,1568829356.0,"There are different types of clinical trials including the ones that follow.

The **clinical trials** to assess new treatments or new ways to make them more effective existing treatments. You can study new drugs or new methods to perform surgery or administer radiotherapy, for example. This is the type of clinical trial in which people with cancer participate most frequently.

The **prevention trials** to assess new ways to reduce the risk of cancer or prevent it from reappearing.

The **screening trials** help to find ways to detect cancer early in humans, before they experience symptoms.

The **diagnostic tests** used to find better ways to diagnose cancer or to determine the stage.

The **trials supportive care** possible to find ways to improve comfort and quality of life for people with cancer or cancer survivors.

## Phases of a clinical trial

The clinical trial that involves a new treatment always takes place in several stages called phases. Each phase is designed to answer specific questions. The following are the most common phases of a cancer clinical trial, as per [Canada Contract Research Organization](https://www.biopharmaservices.com/).

In **phase 1** , a new treatment is often evaluated for the first time in humans. This helps to know how safe it is and what is the best dose to administer. The Phase 1 trial is usually offered to people with advanced cancer who no longer respond to treatment or who have no other treatment options. In general, 15 to 30 people participate in the phase 1 trial.

In **Phase 2** , the degree of effectiveness of a treatment against a certain type of cancer is demonstrated. The extent to which the treatment is safe and the possible side effects continue to be assessed. In general, fewer than 100 people participate in the Phase 2 trial.

In **Phase 3** , a promising new treatment is compared to standard therapy, which is the recognized treatment that is generally given for a condition or illness. Researchers especially want to know if the new treatment is better than the standard treatment. People from around the world can participate in a Phase 3 trial. In general, the number of participants ranges from several hundred to several thousand.

In **Phase 4** , more information is collected on the possible effects of treatment, whether good or bad, after its use has been approved in Canada. In general, several hundred to several thousand people participate in the phase 4 trial.

## Randomized clinical trials

The clinical trial can be designed to include different groups. Most of the time, there are 2 groups, but you can count more. One group is the control group, that is, the participants do not receive the study treatment. The other group is the experimental group, that is, the participants receive the treatment under study.

To make sure groups can be compared, it's a computer that randomly assigns each person to a group. You are as lucky to be part of the experimental group as the control group. This is called randomization.

There are 2 types of randomization.

For **blind randomization** , researchers know who is in the experimental group and who is in the control group, but study participants are unaware of this. This prevents them from doing things that could affect the results of the study.

For **double-blind randomization, trial** participants do not know which group they belong to, just like the researchers. In the field of science, the design of this study seems to be the best since neither researchers nor participants can affect the results of the study by doing things they think they should do depending on the group.

## Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials

Placebo is a pill or injection that looks like the tested substance but has no action at all. Administering a placebo to one of the clinical trial groups allows the researchers to compare the new placebo treatment. No placebo is administered instead of effective standard therapy. In a trial, for example, a new treatment associated with standard treatment with a placebo associated with the standard treatment can be compared. This tells researchers if the new treatment is effective.

Placebo is given in double-blind trials. You will be told if a trial is using a placebo, but you will not know if you are in the placebo group or the researchers elsewhere.",fbug9nl,DeanOnDelivery,1577113883.0,"What an excellent post. About the only thing I possibly can add is a mention of Phase 0. From what I've read from various U.S./FDA based descriptions ... ""**Phase 0**: *Exploratory study involving very limited human exposure to the drug, with no therapeutic or diagnostic goals (for example, screening studies, microdose studies)[^](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/help/glossary/phase)*"" and ""*The purpose of this phase is to help speed up and streamline the drug approval process[^](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18199854)*.""

I would mention that there are detractors to this phase, whose concerns are spelled out in this article '[FDA Introduces New Phase 0 for Clinical Trials : Oncology Times](https://journals.lww.com/oncology-times/Fulltext/2006/08100/FDA_Introduces_New_Phase_0_for_Clinical_Trials_.6.aspx?WT.mc_id=HPxADx20100319xMP).'",4.870845913887024

Site experience is an invaluable career base, and in USoA often troublingly underpaid.  So suck it up for a couple years while you get to know the real deal about trials.  Make sure you get GCP under your belt, then keep moving forward.  Need a start?  Volunteer.

So glad I'm CRO on the far side of the career, but know many others who suffered through the classic CRO couple-years-of-assistant grunt onto wildly successful careers.  Need a start?  Intern your azz off.  Learn everything, especially GCP.

Career success = time, the only asset we all have.  Spend it wisely, and dig in hard.  Get to know GCP - hey, E6 revision three coming soon.  You can learn about that for free.

Thank you!",gyjb8jy,Key_Variation7043,1621315103.0,"Not sure if anyone is still checking in on this thread but I'm still trying to navigate the clinical research world and figure out where I should look next if I want to become a CRA. I found a job working as a research assistant at a large CRO to gain some experience since I don't have any previous clinical experience. I do have a master's in neuroscience and I was hoping with enough experience, I may be able to work my way into a CRA position.

Thank you!",jvlzohx,Sassfra,1691687576.0,"Hi!  Could I suggest some changes?   Could you create a rule on the salary to only include numbers?  Trying to do some analysis and there are a lot of odd/inconsistent values and/or alphanumeric/symbol combinations, random spaces etc

And 2nd suggestion, could you add a field for ""Salary Year"", as required and also number only rule?   Since this is going on 2 years now and with the recent massive shift in inflation/salaries, it would be good to know the year the salary was applicable as time goes on, for trending and ability to assess more recent values only when considering negotiating?  Don't want to negotiate based on what could be several years old data :)

**UPDATE 2023-SEP-05:**   
*Any responses before line 3429 did not have these updates.*

* Added a column for ""year salary was applicable"": You can put a single year or a range of years. Answer is limited to only 9 characters in hopes that there will only be numerical values and the dash, ex: 1989-2023. It is optional as it is implied that the salary added is the salary received in the year of the timestamp.
* Added data rules to salary: It is now only limited to numbers so no symbols can be added and no varying answers.
* Added ""salary comments"" in case anyone wanted to elaborate on their salary. It is optional.
* Column A is now unhid, but small so you still need to expand it. This is for the timestamp.

Thank you!",ijppdvx,thehoneeybeee,1660136822.0,"This is so great! However, my only gripe is that you don’t know when someone entered the information, so it could be a year old. I live in a major city (don’t want to be too identifying here) and got hired by LC for their CRA training program in Feb. I know everyone was getting the same base salary and have heard rumors everyone got a bonus when transitioning into the CRA role. Living in major city on the original salary / the “bonus” didn’t even bump us up to 100K. I am aware of the fact they know CRCs don’t make NEARLY as much as they should, so the salary itself is tempting, but I’m now in the deep end in a field I don’t have any previous experience in (oncology). I have heard from previous training program folx that they had upwards of 30 sites within the 1st 3 months post training program! Originally most of my group were transitioned ~10 sites after graduating the program. However, I already have had 2 break downs within 4 days because I was being thrown almost 10 more sites, as people appear to be going on sudden LoAs. This makes me think they either have high turnover over OR they over burden their people until they break down. 
I spoke with the person who recommended me for the position and was with this company for 20+ years. They said that this definitely became the norm before they retired (constantly being given more sites/work, especially with the numerous & various programs you have to use).  They didn’t even retire for an extra year, because there was still so much to do and were offered an extra 14K. (I personally would have tried to leverage more than that.)

* Added a column for ""year salary was applicable"": You can put a single year or a range of years. Answer is limited to only 9 characters in hopes that there will only be numerical values and the dash, ex: 1989-2023. It is optional as it is implied that the salary added is the salary received in the year of the timestamp.
* Added data rules to salary: It is now only limited to numbers so no symbols can be added and no varying answers.
* Added ""salary comments"" in case anyone wanted to elaborate on their salary. It is optional.
* Column A is now unhid, but small so you still need to expand it. This is for the timestamp.

I made a Google form that we can all fill out anonymously about our role and salary. u/snoopypoo31's recent post is what initiated the creation. I based it off responses from their thread, from my colleagues’ suggestions, & from the [original media spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11obKJpckWJNyEYPdhHM0iaGp0x4QoVk_7aitRC5zVlc/edit#gid=70710369) I had previously mentioned. Please feel free to share with your colleagues in the field. I really hope this can be a resource for people. I think it's important to have transparency & it can help with wage or contract negotiations.

**UPDATE 2023-SEP-05:**   
*Any responses before line 3429 did not have these updates.*

* Added a column for ""year salary was applicable"": You can put a single year or a range of years. Answer is limited to only 9 characters in hopes that there will only be numerical values and the dash, ex: 1989-2023. It is optional as it is implied that the salary added is the salary received in the year of the timestamp.
* Added data rules to salary: It is now only limited to numbers so no symbols can be added and no varying answers.
* Added ""salary comments"" in case anyone wanted to elaborate on their salary. It is optional.
* Column A is now unhid, but small so you still need to expand it. This is for the timestamp.

I started with no experience (and with a PharmM though) and I'm 6 months into the CRO now. 
How long should it pass before asking for a raise, or before they will really consider you for another role? 
IHCRA role is listed as entry level. However, at job's requirements they mention you should have at least 1y of CTA experience when applying for this role (which seems kind of unfair when taking into account that many people apply for IHCRA with no experience without going through CTA role first).",4.55547159910202

**UPDATE 2023-SEP-05:**   
*Any responses before line 3429 did not have these updates.*

* Added a column for ""year salary was applicable"": You can put a single year or a range of years. Answer is limited to only 9 characters in hopes that there will only be numerical values and the dash, ex: 1989-2023. It is optional as it is implied that the salary added is the salary received in the year of the timestamp.
* Added data rules to salary: It is now only limited to numbers so no symbols can be added and no varying answers.
* Added ""salary comments"" in case anyone wanted to elaborate on their salary. It is optional.
* Column A is now unhid, but small so you still need to expand it. This is for the timestamp.

Take opportunities any way you can get them. This year in the industry salaries are nuts.

**UPDATE 2023-SEP-05:**   
*Any responses before line 3429 did not have these updates.*

* Added a column for ""year salary was applicable"": You can put a single year or a range of years. Answer is limited to only 9 characters in hopes that there will only be numerical values and the dash, ex: 1989-2023. It is optional as it is implied that the salary added is the salary received in the year of the timestamp.
* Added data rules to salary: It is now only limited to numbers so no symbols can be added and no varying answers.
* Added ""salary comments"" in case anyone wanted to elaborate on their salary. It is optional.
* Column A is now unhid, but small so you still need to expand it. This is for the timestamp.

I made a Google form that we can all fill out anonymously about our role and salary. u/snoopypoo31's recent post is what initiated the creation.

**UPDATE 2023-SEP-05:**   
*Any responses before line 3429 did not have these updates.*

* Added a column for ""year salary was applicable"": You can put a single year or a range of years. Answer is limited to only 9 characters in hopes that there will only be numerical values and the dash, ex: 1989-2023. It is optional as it is implied that the salary added is the salary received in the year of the timestamp.
* Added data rules to salary: It is now only limited to numbers so no symbols can be added and no varying answers.
* Added ""salary comments"" in case anyone wanted to elaborate on their salary. It is optional.
* Column A is now unhid, but small so you still need to expand it. This is for the timestamp.

* Added data rules to salary: It is now only limited to numbers so no symbols can be added and no varying answers.
* Added ""salary comments"" in case anyone wanted to elaborate on their salary. It is optional.
* Column A is now unhid, but small so you still need to expand it. This is for the timestamp.

I made a Google form that we can all fill out anonymously about our role and salary. u/snoopypoo31's recent post is what initiated the creation. I based it off responses from their thread, from my colleagues’ suggestions, & from the [original media spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11obKJpckWJNyEYPdhHM0iaGp0x4QoVk_7aitRC5zVlc/edit#gid=70710369) I had previously mentioned. Please feel free to share with your colleagues in the field. I really hope this can be a resource for people. I think it's important to have transparency & it can help with wage or contract negotiations.

*Any responses before line 3429 did not have these updates.*

* Added a column for ""year salary was applicable"": You can put a single year or a range of years.

* Added ""salary comments"" in case anyone wanted to elaborate on their salary. It is optional.
* Column A is now unhid, but small so you still need to expand it. This is for the timestamp.

**UPDATE 2023-SEP-05:**   
*Any responses before line 3429 did not have these updates.*

* Added a column for ""year salary was applicable"": You can put a single year or a range of years. Answer is limited to only 9 characters in hopes that there will only be numerical values and the dash, ex: 1989-2023. It is optional as it is implied that the salary added is the salary received in the year of the timestamp.
* Added data rules to salary: It is now only limited to numbers so no symbols can be added and no varying answers.
* Added ""salary comments"" in case anyone wanted to elaborate on their salary. It is optional.
* Column A is now unhid, but small so you still need to expand it. This is for the timestamp.

I made a Google form that we can all fill out anonymously about our role and salary. u/snoopypoo31's recent post is what initiated the creation. I based it off responses from their thread, from my colleagues’ suggestions, & from the [original media spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11obKJpckWJNyEYPdhHM0iaGp0x4QoVk_7aitRC5zVlc/edit#gid=70710369) I had previously mentioned. Please feel free to share with your colleagues in the field. I really hope this can be a resource for people. I think it's important to have transparency & it can help with wage or contract negotiations.

1eu65zi,clinicalresearch,My experience as a CRC at the VA,Either-Spinach-4707,1723859110.0,"This is going to be mostly a vent post but might be helpful for other ppl. I'm currently a CRC at a VA hospital and my previous job was as an RA in clinical research at a university-affiliated hospital, both in psychiatry/mental health. My experience at the VA has been so different from my other experience and not in a good way. Some VAs are also university-affiliated but the one I work at is just a VA hospital.

First off, getting hired by the federal government is an annoyingly long, ardous process. On top of typical hiring tasks there is a security clearance, background check, and fingerprinting. Oh and even if you don't have your badge by the time you start, you technically aren't able to access anything. When I started, it took them a week and a half to get my badge. I couldn't even do the required onboarding trainings because you have to complete them through the VA intranet.

On to the clinical research-related issues. This is most likely just my PI/lab but my team is small - just me and other person. When I first started, we had one study, one that was pending IRB approval, and one potential in the pipeline. I was going to be the lead on the existing study and my co-worker was going to be the lead on the pending one so our workload split was supposed to be 60/40 and 40/60 for the two studies, respectively. Now, on paper that doesn't sound too bad right? Well, the pending approval study was approved in the first month I started and it has been a shitshow from the start. I don't want to give too many details for privacy sake but the study activities for that study are insanely involved, not just for us but also the participants. There are so many things for us to keep track of and tasks to do for every single visit that we're both basically 80/20 on that study. If I didn't help my co-worker with the workload they'd have drowned 2 months ago. There also isn't exactly a good system to keep track of things because of the limitations we have regarding applications we can use. To give you an idea, every Google application except Maps is blocked on the intranet.

Onto that study in the pipeline, well we got approved as a site and I am in charge of site start-up, which I have never done before and am having to basically run around to various departments to ask for help on the inital submission. What makes that one even more complicated are two things. Firstly, the PI is one that has never been a PI for a clinical research study before but is being mentored by my PI, who will act as a sub-I, and I am being ""borrowed"" as the CRC for it. I don't know how I'll have time to serve as the CRC for this study if and when we get site-approval. Secondly, it's an industry-sponsored study so there's a whole different process regarding the IRB submissions/approvals and I only started doing IRB-related tasks with this job so I'm still learning the ropes of IRB stuff in general. The cherry on top is that the CRO and Sponsor we're working with have never had the VA as a site before and didn't realize how much red-tape they would have to deal with. Don't get me started on the VA IRB, just know they follow government timeliness. 

I also have a couple other things that my PI has tasked me with that he's been nudging me on, including a grant proposal for another multisite study. My co-worker has also recently been tasked with a new role that is so time-consuming it eats at least 30-40% of their time on a daily basis. We are spread so thin between the two of us, I'm not sure we'll make it to December.

Slightly unrelated but the reason I mostly have worked in psychiatric research is because I was considering a Clinical Psychology PhD. I've struggled with multiple mental health issues, most notably depression, which spurred me to want to pursue research in Clinical Psychology. However, this has become a double edged sword because my PI is a psychiatrist and working in mental health research just seems so poeticly ironic for me to have a major depessive episode, probably the worst one since 10 years ago. It's bad enough that both my psychiatrist and therapist have suggested I may need to think about higher level of mental health care, which usually is quite time-consuming, time that I do not have. My psychiatrist even offered to write a letter to request either accommodation or a leave of absence/something similar. Now I don't know whether my PI would actually see the letter or if it's just HR but I would much rather get vaporized on the spot rather than have him know anything about my current mental wellbeing.

Probably the only upside of the position is that because it's a federal job, up until this point, I have been able to keep work stress from bleeding into other facets of my life. This is because in order to access anything work-related you have to be plugged into the VA intranet. So as soon as I log off I'm basically not accessible unless someone has my personal number - that means no Teams, Outlook, etc. unless you have a government-furnished laptop and/or phone. It's not automatically granted either and mostly depends on the position. You can request for one but the process is frustratingly long and it isn't guaranteed IT will approve your request.

Maybe I'm blowing things out of proportion and I'm just being a little bitch about everything but god knows I needed to put this somewhere. I probably forgot a bunch of things but I think I've covered most of it so I'll leave it at this. I am slightly paranoid that I've provided info wherein someone may be able to connect the dots. But I highly doubt it because they'd probably have to have work with me in some capacity to know all these details and at this point I am so far gone mentally, I just don't care about anything, let alone my life.",linmtur,Old_Entrepreneur_967,1723946695.0,"Sorry to hear you are having such a poor experience! I also work as a CRC at the VA but love it. If I can offer some advice: Part of working at the VA is knowing the right people to contact for things, which is difficult when you are new. Is there a research AO or ACOS that you can reach out to for guidance? Are there other CRC or PI teams you know that can help you? Esp in regards to navigating the VA IRB (which is a whole other beast) or SOPs. Is there a NODES coordinator or other bigger studies open you can use for resources?
I’m happy to give you some tips if you want to send me more specific questions-for instance you say you are having trouble keeping track of things because of the intranet limitations. Our teams uses a combo Teams, Slack, excel, and sharepoint for task tracking all without issue.

1etp83w,clinicalresearch,A CRO offered wife a CRA position but it seems too good to be true ,itsmeagain321,1723815990.0,"Hi everyone. I apologize if this isn't the correct place to ask this but I would appreciate some guidance on this matter if you would be willing.

My wife is attempting to become a CRA and we've recently been applying for any and all positions. We've recently had a company reach out and offer her a position. It's at max tier starting pay with potentially a highly regarded company. It seems like a scam because she has received the offer of employment without going through any type of interview process apart from some screening questions. We can't locate the hiring manager associated with the company on LinkedIn or anywhere for that fact and he didn't supply us with a contact number for us to call. He uses to company logo but in writing it's ""Company Name  Research"" when that isn't anywhere on the official page.

Our next thought is to call the company to see if it is a legit offer but in our experience the right hand doesn't always talk to the left and we might not get the correct information.

What are your thoughts? Should she proceed with this as this is similar to your hiring situation or should she distance herself?

UPDATE: 
Thank you for all your input and advice.
Just wanted to add that nothing of major importance was shared with the scammer. No bank info or other personally identifiable information apart from a phone number and email (it could be worse).

As you've all assumed it was indeed a scam. After my wife called the company(Immunity Bio) they confirmed that it was in fact not legitimate.

1etp83w,clinicalresearch,A CRO offered wife a CRA position but it seems too good to be true ,itsmeagain321,1723815990.0,"Hi everyone. I apologize if this isn't the correct place to ask this but I would appreciate some guidance on this matter if you would be willing.

My wife is attempting to become a CRA and we've recently been applying for any and all positions. We've recently had a company reach out and offer her a position. It's at max tier starting pay with potentially a highly regarded company. It seems like a scam because she has received the offer of employment without going through any type of interview process apart from some screening questions. We can't locate the hiring manager associated with the company on LinkedIn or anywhere for that fact and he didn't supply us with a contact number for us to call. He uses to company logo but in writing it's ""Company Name  Research"" when that isn't anywhere on the official page.

Our next thought is to call the company to see if it is a legit offer but in our experience the right hand doesn't always talk to the left and we might not get the correct information.

What are your thoughts? Should she proceed with this as this is similar to your hiring situation or should she distance herself?

UPDATE: 
Thank you for all your input and advice.
Just wanted to add that nothing of major importance was shared with the scammer. No bank info or other personally identifiable information apart from a phone number and email (it could be worse).

I feel like I do really well in interviews and have even attended seminars recently to build up those skills, where the hosts only give me minor pointers.

Professionally, I’ve been a resident assistant (customer service), COVID case investigator, and health non-profit volunteer manager (administrative tasks & project management).

However, you can also move into more lab/sample management roles which run pretty parallel the clin ops pillar.

On Monday 8/12 I got two separate invitations for AI/ pre-recorded interviews for two different clinical trial assistants positions.  I immediately completed them and within two hours I was rejected via email from one of the roles and the application moved from “active” to “completed” on workday.  Today, the other application also moved to “completed”, but I have not received an email letting me know I have been rejected.  I have two questions for anyone who might have a thought: 

1) Do you think I was rejected from the second role? Or is the “completed” application label unrelated to your application status? 

2) Is it crazy that I’m looking into a trial assistant position when I’m a research manager in academia? I’ve applied to multiple levels of research in industry positions with no luck. I have 4 years of experience in observational research and a masters of public health. I have reached the ceiling in my current role. My PI is also looking to retire.

Today, the other application also moved to “completed”, but I have not received an email letting me know I have been rejected.  I have two questions for anyone who might have a thought: 

1) Do you think I was rejected from the second role? Or is the “completed” application label unrelated to your application status? 

2) Is it crazy that I’m looking into a trial assistant position when I’m a research manager in academia? I’ve applied to multiple levels of research in industry positions with no luck. I have 4 years of experience in observational research and a masters of public health. I have reached the ceiling in my current role. My PI is also looking to retire.  I lasted this long with him because I was completing a masters and and frankly, we get along well. But the pay is shitty and again, nowhere to go from here.  Breaking into industry seems next to impossible unless you start at the lowest level.  But it seems like you can climb up fast if you hustle. What do you think?

What are your thoughts?,li4w9z4,cstrdmnd,1723669116.0,"Of course! I started as a lab manager working in an immunology wet lab right out of college. It ended up being a great jumping point because I worked for a MD PhD, so he also had PI initiated studies. I got to see how a clinical trial starts from the earliest stages— got to write our own grants, wrote protocols, wrote the consent and even designed a mouse model. In retrospect, it’s a unique perspective since most people don’t see the pre-clinical work for first in human studies. Also great that we collaborated with labs in Europe and Japan to swap samples and publish together, so I got a small glimpse of non-US regulations. 

Since I had experience consenting patients and a good grasp of early trials, the next job I did was a CRC role in a public academic hospital. I mostly did oncology sponsor trials and some PI Initiated. It was probably one of the harder jobs I’ve had since I did all the sample collections, screening, consent, data, regulatory, etc etc. I left that job in less than a year cause I was heading towards burnout and I didn’t want to lose momentum. 

My next role was also a CRC role, but it was now in a large oncology hospital that was very much seasoned in running clinical trials. Since I had oncology experience already, I came on as a Senior CRC and did  Phase 1 solid tumor. This hospital was great since they had a whole Regulatory department, a sample collections department and dedicated research nurses. I mostly screened patients, did consents, entered data and attended sponsor meetings. We also had weekly tumor boards. The whole experience was great for me because the PIs knew we practically had the protocols memorized, so they would ask us for information. It was more collaborative than deferential. I probably would have stayed in this role longer but I left after 5 months to join a sponsor role. 

My current job, I started as an in house CRA at a medical device company. That position was more focused on Data Review and minimal regulatory. We were mainly assigned to one or two studies and were subject matter experts. Eventually we had a re-org and we no longer support studies with data review. Now we support our field colleagues with regulatory, documentation and training. They did change our titles to better align with industry, so we’d most likely be Site Management. But since our role is so involved in study startup, they do pay us better than our Regulatory Affairs counterparts. 

The most important thing is to read the job description not the title, especially at sponsors. I avoided CROs because I knew the roles would be cookie cutter. I tried to take on interesting positions and leveraged ANY experience I had. I had zero medical device experience but I was upfront about that during my interview. I was very confident that my IND experience could be pivoted & I demonstrated a good general understanding of clinical research.",4.944111466407776

Additionally, it is very sought after by those who have already done their time with 3+ years of traveling, so they are usually first in line for going remote. Some CROs are also offshoring the rCRA role for US sites to other experienced CRAs in LATAM to save money, although I am not confident that the communication quality is worth it long term in most cases when they do that, and it's a slap in the face to experienced US-based CRAs.",4.816190123558044

Meanwhile, the senior CRAs are overloaded with work and burning out because the CROs aren't able to put any junior people into the pipeline to help balance the workload, and some studies are delayed in getting CRAs assigned because all the senior CRAs at the CRO are already stretched across other studies, but the sponsor is still adamant about not accepting a CRA 1 even if paired with a senior CRA.",4.711486041545868

",li0d49s,secretly_treebeard,1723601525.0,"A few suggestions: first, restrict your resume to one page. You should only be going onto two pages once you have extensive work experience in your field. I’d say you can probably remove your intern role - not super relevant and it’s old. If you do keep it though, make sure to italicize Mycobacterium tuberculosis. I also agree with the other commentator about removing personal interests in your skills section. In your MLS trainee role, your second bullet erroneously breaks into a third bullet point - fix this. Fourth bullet in the same role doesn’t make sense - I think the “a” before “highlighting” is not meant to be there. Don’t use ampersands in place of “and” (unless the ampersand is part of a specific name). Also I personally would spell out every abbreviation at first mention (this is best practice), but it’s probably something you could get away with not doing.

Also, this is perhaps contentious advice, but are you writing cover letters? There’s a huge debate as to whether they’re necessary or not, but I think in your situation it might be really helpful because you can talk about why you’re looking to move out of your role after less than a year and can highlight how the things you’ve learned in your current and past roles will set you up for success, including soft skills. Like as a MLS, you’ll likely be good at noticing details - give an example for people who don’t know about what being an MLS entails about so that they can get a better sense of what skills you possess.

And as another person said, just keep trying! The job market is tough right now and it’s especially hard for people who haven’t been in the field for super long.",4.658244490623474

1erkgv9,clinicalresearch,I would greatly appreciate your insights and advice! ,Teafor2withu,1723587026.0,"Hello! I’m reaching out with the hope that you might be able to assist me or offer me some much needed advice. I am currently in the process of transitioning out of a doctoral program in a clinical discipline for a number of reasons, the top reason being dissatisfaction with the work, leading to a lot of dread and unhappiness that is just not sustainable. I have a Masters degree in a life science, and a nice record of publication as a part of my graduate schooling. I realized that I really prefer work involving clear task completion, less uncertainty and ambiguity, and less emotional weight, ultimately allowing me to “leave work at work.” I’ve been involved in research to one extent or another for the past 8 years, and spent 3 years prior to my doctoral degree as a research assistant at an AMC (not in clinical trials work, but biologically-based work involving phlebotomy, IRBs, vital signs, human subjects, recruitment, consent processes, publishing, ethics etc). Although my discipline did not fit me well, I have managed research assistants throughout my career, and really enjoyed my own time working as a research assistant, which makes me think that being in the clinical research world could be a really nice fit. I am a novice in the clinical trials world, however, and could really use your help and any advice you might be able to offer me. I am interviewing for a CRC or Senior CRC role at a CRO this week. Is working for a CRO a positive first step? If I do say so myself, I am competent, bright, quick, ethical, personable, and believe I can contribute positively and productively to any workplace environment. What questions should I be asking to gain a good sense of the work life balance and opportunities I should be looking for in this role? I am ultimately looking to advance beyond the CRC role, but understand how important experience is in this line of work. I’m absolutely willing and wanting to learn, but I also want to be on the lookout for specific opportunities that can set me up for success. ANY insights, recommendations, or advice would be so, so helpful. Thank you so much! 

Edit: sorry, it’s not a CRO! It’s a hybrid organization that supports clinical trials by collaborating with sponsors, CROs, and sites. ",,,,,4.680865049362183

Toxic injury of the liver should likely also give a elevated GGT, ashwaganda is known to cause liver injury, so quitting it to see what happens is good advice.

Furthermore AST is not specific to the liver, it’s also present in muscles. So I don’t know how hard you work out, but since working out causes muscle injury this could also be a reason, there is no need for intervention then.

1eum7zz,Medical,"Elevated AST levels, normal ALT..",Final-Designer-388,1723913327.0,"For the past couple years, my AST levels have consistently been slightly elevated but normal ALT levels. Doctor is recommending an upper abdomen ultrasound to investigate gallbladder and liver, also recommended a hepatitis B screening. I take a multi vitamin, 300mg Goli Ashwaganda before bed to help with sleep.

I have Dr. Googled elevated AST, normal ALT levels and it seems that working out could throw the AST off in this scenario? Any thoughts on that? I do workout (weight lift) specifically,  and did so the day before the blood test..

It seems that when I started working out and losing weight from 2017 - present, the levels are elevated. I have lost roughly 25ish pounds since 2017 but lately have been more committed to muscle building to gain strength. I am 120 pounds. 

I drink maybe 1 or 2 drinks per week, socially.  A couple years ago I did drink more (maybe 1-2 drinks per day) but have significantly cut-down over the past two years. 

AST is ranging around the 42-48 level the past several years, ALT around 26.

At the beginning of my ""health kick"" I also incorporated daily maca root powder, chia seeds, and flax seeds into my diet.. ",lileec0,Retired-MedLab-Guy,1723916339.0,"One likes to see one isolated test that is an outlier being confirmed or reflected upon by other tests. If the hepatic function blood panel is also completely normal then the origin of the elevation would argue against it being of liver origin. Imaging studies will confirm that hopefully. 

The AST can be of red blood cell origin also and that can happen when blood samples are hemolyzed while trying to collect a blood sample with difficult blood draws. Since you state that it is a common occurrence that has been going on with regular repeat draws then that is not high on the list as a possibility for the elevation.

The other major source of AST and the most common besides liver is muscle origin. Muscle damage usually as a result of over-exercising can result in some elevation. This can be confirmed with CK testing or aldolase or other markers for muscle damage. Again one likes to confirm an isolated elevation with other tests. 

Finally, the last possibility is rare but with the emphasis of an isolated AST elevation and that is what is called macro-AST. An antibody is present that combines with the AST which makes it difficult for the clearance of AST that normally occurs and it starts to build up in the body and artificially raises the levels not because of the increase production or generation but because it can't be degraded or cleared from circulation like it normally is.

""Laboratory evaluation was significant only for an elevated serum AST of 314 IU/L (normal: 20 IU/L). As the remainder of the lab work was normal, the patient was asked to stop taking dietary supplements. A repeat follow-up AST level remained elevated. He tested negative for viral hepatitis, muscle disorders, and metabolic and autoimmune liver diseases. Imaging was unrevealing. He was referred to the hepatology clinic for a second opinion. With no evidence of underlying liver disease and only AST elevation on repeated testing, the patient was evaluated for the presence of macro-AST using polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. PEG precipitation revealed 88.2% precipitable activity with a post-PEG precipitation AST level of 16 IU/L, confirming the presence of macro-AST.""

If the doctor can't figure out why it is elevated without further testing then that last one is the way to go as you might be stuck with that for the distant future and keep that in mind whenever testing is done. One would alert the doctor of that fact if they forget or are new.",4.7332029938697815

In this study, we ask you to consume the same amount of food that you normally would and to continue your regular care for bipolar disorder. We would assign you to one of these food plans.

We are a group of investigators from the University of Memphis conducting a research study on learning behaviors related to motivations and goals in video games. The goal of the study is to examine the relationship between motivations/goals and practice, repetition, and performance in a casual online racing game called Space Race, initially developed by students at UofM.

If you agree to participate, you will be asked to visit a website on your personal computer or laptop, fill out a pre-questionnaire on Qualtrics, play the game at least 10 times (about 4 minutes per session), and fill out a post-questionnaire on Qualtrics.  During the game, you will be asked to share your game screen and enable your camera and microphone so that your eye gaze, expressions, and vocalizations can be captured. When you choose to stop playing the game, the screen sharing, microphone, and camera recordings will terminate.  You can choose to perform these activities at any time during a one-week period. The entire study will take about an hour of active participation.

You must have access to a personal computer or laptop with a camera, be 18+ years of age, be proficient in English, and be a currently enrolled student. You will receive a $10 Amazon gift card after completing the study. If you have any questions about volunteering for the study, please contact the principal investigator, Dr. Brandon M.

He started the exam by squeezing my glans hard by crushing it and then stretched my penis hard.  He also squeezed the base of my shaft extremely hard too.  These are supposedly ""normal"" exam tests.  Since then I have been completely numb in my penis with total erectile dysfunction that no amount of medication helps.  I've never had erectile dysfunction in my life and now I haven't had an erection in 4 months.

I have tried high dose Cialis and Viagra and neither have an effect whatsoever.  My penis is so numb I can't feel anything at all in it.  No touch, pressure, hot, cold, pain, nothing.  It's like the nerve has been severed.  I can't feel my penis anymore or get an erection anymore.

Firstly let’s talk getting an erection (for now), viagra (sildenafil) hasn’t worked but looking at the NHS info page there’s multiple other options you should try in the first instance:

“If sildenafil does not work, there are other tablets you could try that work in a similar way, such as:

tadalafil (Cialis) – can be taken up to 36 hours before sex
avanafil (Spedra) – can be taken up to around 4 hours before sex
vardenafil (Levitra) – can be taken up to around 4 hours before sex

You could also try a medicine called alprostadil. This is a synthetic hormone that helps to stimulate blood flow to the penis.

Alprostadil comes as:

an injection directly into your penis
a small pellet placed inside your urethra (the tube that carries pee from your bladder to the tip of your penis)

If you cannot get erections because of a hormonal problem, your GP may refer you to an endocrinologist (who specialises in the treatment of hormonal problems).

You may benefit from treatment using injections of synthetic hormones to restore your hormone levels to normal.”

———-

So give those a go. HOWEVER there is a couple of case studies of nerve injury (from crushes to the penis) and a working theory that some persistent erectile dysfunction may come from damage to a nerve in the penis - cavernoma nerve.

Now the only mechanism that would probably fit would be the pulling. The only way I can think to prove this is be referred for NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES.

So if I were you I would be pushing for a referral for a nerve conduction study, this may require a neurosurgical/neurology discussion. If there is damage to the peripheral nerve then there is treatment targeted available and in development (see below). There are other causes for peripheral nerve damage (diabetes for example) and I would hope a good work-up would exclude that.

In the mean time there is a full ladder of treatment to try. Don’t lose hope.

I might be posting in the wrong subreddit, but I didn't know where else to ask.
after all, I don't think I have something related to this. 
But anyway, I have been sick with symptoms since November of last year. It started out just with constant, unexplained fevers that would not go away and no blood tests would reveal a cause. It was just this, malaise, and some very bad pain in my face until around February. 
In January just FYI, I had gone to the children's Hospital of Philadelphia. I am 17 years old, and female. We were going because of my fevers unexplained nature. my mother didn't tell me, but it was obvious the special she had tried to see was a rheumatologist. She was leaning towards fibromyalgia, for whatever reason.
I went and had the appointment and the rheumatologist there said it could be fibromyalgia. But she said that that did not explain the fevers. These fevers are still ongoing.
in February the symptoms worsened, though. Only then it was just worse malaise and exhaustion, terrible neck pain and pain in my ears, continued fevers, shakiness, very high blood pressure and poor circulation, and even for a few weeks, my legs were very stiff and it was difficult to walk. I also had a day where the corners of my mouth moved on their own, and my tongue was very numb and it was difficult to speak. I also had that fear mood thing and weird changes to my behavior like that on being on too much of a drug.
almost all of this is ongoing now, except the leg thickness comes and goes, and there are different neurological issues. 
I have my own blood oxygen checker, and I find my blood oxygen to regularly be 95 or below. I am very dizzy, very exhausted, and last month the pain in my entire body tripled. It's not muscle soreness, and it hurts all the way way through my body, down to my fingertips. I had to write this with text to speech because it hurt my fingertips so bad. And the tingling is awful. 
I asked my uncle about it, curious because my grandmother had a cancer that caused nerve pain. He said that my pain sounded exactly like my grandmother's nerve pain. 
i've also had recent neurological issues were parts of my body twitch a lot for a long time. There is still some stiffness in my body, and one day, even my mouth partially was paralyzed. It went away after 20 minutes on its own. My weight has also been fluctuating up and down a lot.
If I had to say the worst of the pain, it would probably be the exhaustion, the sweatiness, the terrible ache, nonstop and acute all over my body, the stomach pain that is mixed between a cramp, stabbing pain and nausea, it feels like there's a stone in my belly.  The terrible pain in my neck and my ears, specifically my right ear. The doctor found an infection in ear, and I got eardrop antibiotics which made the pain go away. Now for some reason it's back.
it's awful. It's so so awful. I am almost constantly crying because of it. And staying home and laying down. Not to mention the parts, especially at night where the pain worsen and it causes that fear thing again. I feel like I might lose my mind. 
You might wonder where my parents are in all this and my primary care physician. Well, they will not do anything. My primary care physician refuses to see me, and if he does, he doesn't do an examination, he just listens to me, talking says he cannot help me. He will not even make a specialist referral. 
I have seen a neurologist, and even an immunologist. but those were both long enough time ago, months ago. My symptoms have changed a lot since then. 
they did a lot of blood tests in the beginning, or so I was told, which apparently revealed absolutely nothing except a low immunoglobulin a. 
My parents have been absolutely nonchalant, and they do not care. They do not listen to me when I say I am not being helped. They tell me to go away. all literally, they did. 
My mother used to make fun of me for my symptoms and tell me it was in my head, but she changed her tune really quickly when the symptoms worsened, and I saw a psychiatrist who told her repeatedly I am not psychosomatic. now she just says she doesn't care.
I have tried child protective services. I eventually just gave up on getting a diagnosis and tried to get past my symptoms.
I still feel that way, but recently they have just gotten into an unbearable point. I cannot even think clearly, and I've never really been taught a lot of information on how hospitals work. I really don't have any idea what to do to try and get someone to treat my pain. I don't even need a diagnosis or explanation, I just want ongoing treatment.
its so so so so awful. I can't take it anymore. between the physical pain and even the fear, both control my nights and my days, and have completely made me cancel a lot because I have not been able to bring myself to do it.
Please, somebody help me help me please. I don't know what else to do anymore, please help me. tell me what to do so I can get treatment for this pain. I want to jump off a bridge or something. In my head, I know everything is fine, it's just the amount of pain this has put me in. 
please tell me what to do. I beg you. Thank you.

1emj4p0,cancerresearch,TRBC1-targeting antibody-drug conjugates for the treatment of T cell cancers ,maisonslament,1723054626.0,"
Abstract

Antibody and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-mediated targeted therapies have improved survival in patients with solid and haematologic malignancies1-9. Adults with T cell leukaemias and lymphomas, collectively called T cell cancers, have short survival and lack such targeted therapies. Thus, T cell cancers particularly warrant the development of CAR T cells and antibodies to improve patient outcomes. Preclinical studies showed that targeting T cell receptor β-chain constant region 1 (TRBC1) can kill cancerous T cells while preserving sufficient healthy T cells to maintain immunity, making TRBC1 an attractive target to treat T cell cancers. However, the first-in-human clinical trial of anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells reported a low response rate and unexplained loss of anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells. Here we demonstrate that CAR T cells are lost due to killing by the patient's normal T cells, reducing their efficacy. To circumvent this issue, we developed an antibody-drug conjugate that could kill TRBC1+ cancer cells in vitro and cure human T cell cancers in mouse models. The anti-TRBC1 antibody-drug conjugate may provide an optimal format for TRBC1 targeting and produce superior responses in patients with T cell cancers.

xb534q,cancerresearch,Lactate inhibits tumor growth by increasing stemness of CD8+ T cells to augment anti-tumor immunity,hotpot_ai,1662857926.0,"**Key Points**

* An acidic tumor microenvironment is immunosuppressive and correlates with adverse clinical outcomes. Aerobic glycolysis, a common metabolic pathway for cancer cells, produces lactic acid and its conjugate base, lactate.
* Researchers discovered an unexpected immunostimulatory effect with lactate.  After subjecting mice with M38 colon cancer to subcutaneous administration of sodium lactate, the researchers found that sodium lactate yielded multiple T-cell benefits: increased tumor infiltration, enhanced T-cell potency, and reduced death by apoptosis. The benefits were more pronounced when paired with a PD-1 inhibitor or a PC7A nanovaccine, even inducing remission in some cases.
* Lactate increased CD8+ T cell stemness and elevated expression of the transcription factor, TCF-1. Mechanistically, lactate inhibits histone deacetylase activity, which results in increased acetylation at H3K27 of the *Tcf7* super enhancer locus, leading to increased *Tcf7* gene expression.

**Abstract**

Lactate is a key metabolite produced from glycolytic metabolism of glucose molecules, yet it also serves as a primary carbon fuel source for many cell types. In the tumor-immune microenvironment, effect of lactate on cancer and immune cells can be highly complex and hard to decipher, which is further confounded by acidic protons, a co-product of glycolysis. Here we show that lactate is able to increase stemness of CD8+ T cells and augments anti-tumor immunity. Subcutaneous administration of sodium lactate but not glucose to mice bearing transplanted MC38 tumors results in CD8+ T cell-dependent tumor growth inhibition. Single cell transcriptomics analysis reveals increased proportion of stem-like TCF-1-expressing CD8+ T cells among intra-tumoral CD3+ cells, a phenotype validated by in vitro lactate treatment of T cells. Mechanistically, lactate inhibits histone deacetylase activity, which results in increased acetylation at H3K27 of the *Tcf7* super enhancer locus, leading to increased *Tcf7* gene expression. CD8+ T cells in vitro pre-treated with lactate efficiently inhibit tumor growth upon adoptive transfer to tumor-bearing mice. Our results provide evidence for an intrinsic role of lactate in anti-tumor immunity independent of the pH-dependent effect of lactic acid, and might advance cancer immune therapy.

&#x200B;

**Methods**

* Experimented on *Rag1*\-knockout mice, which are unable to produce B or T cells. Of various types of immune cells, only depletion of CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cells abolished the effect of the sodium lactate treatment, pointing at those cells as the sole mediators of sodium lactate’s tumor-suppressing effects.
* Treated donor-derived human T cells with sodium lactate in vitro. Just like in vivo, the treatment increased the cells’ stemness by upregulating TCF1 and several other stemness-related proteins. The treatment also decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells.
* Re-introduced mouse T cells treated with sodium lactate into tumor-bearing mice, which produced spectacular dose-dependent results. While 500 thousand pre-treated T cells was enough to significantly impede tumor growth, 2 million cells actually reverted it.

wbnnnp,cancerresearch,"Pritzker researchers engineered Interleukin-12 to only activate when cleaved by tumor ""molecular scissors"", avoiding toxic side-effects and inducing tumor regression greater than anti-PD1 in some cancers and complete elimination in colon cancer",hotpot_ai,1659151920.0,"**Key Points**

* Interleukin-12 (IL-12) once inspired hope as a potent anti-cancer molecule, but trials from decades ago revealed toxic side effects. While the cytokine effectively killed tumors, it also triggered toxic inflammation throughout the body.
* Pritzker researchers engineered IL-12 to only activate when near tumour-associated proteases, which are like molecular scissors that let tumors cut healthy tissue. This modification addressed the toxicity from earlier trials while still inducing substantial regression in some cancers and even eliminating the tumor completely in colon cancer.
* The site-specific activation occurs because the researchers masked the domain of the IL-12 receptor, preventing it from triggering an immune response until a tumor-associated protease cleaves it.

**Abstract**

Immune-checkpoint inhibitors have shown modest efficacy against immunologically ‘cold’ tumours. Interleukin-12 (IL-12)—a cytokine that promotes the recruitment of immune cells into tumours as well as immune cell activation, also in cold tumours—can cause severe immune-related adverse events in patients. Here, by exploiting the preferential overexpression of proteases in tumours, we show that fusing a domain of the IL-12 receptor to IL-12 via a linker cleavable by tumour-associated proteases largely restricts the pro-inflammatory effects of IL-12 to tumour sites. In mouse models of subcutaneous adenocarcinoma and orthotopic melanoma, masked IL-12 delivered intravenously did not cause systemic IL-12 signalling and eliminated systemic immune-related adverse events, led to potent therapeutic effects via the remodelling of the immune-suppressive microenvironment, and rendered cold tumours responsive to immune-checkpoint inhibition. We also show that masked IL-12 is activated in tumour lysates from patients. Protease-sensitive masking of potent yet toxic cytokines may facilitate their clinical translation.

uedydm,cancerresearch,"Stanford researchers enhance CAR-T therapy against solid tumors by delivering CAR-T cells with simple-to-make, injectable hydrogel instead of intravenous (IV) infusion",hotpot_ai,1651206783.0,"**Key Points**

* CAR-T therapy is promising against lymphomas but not solid tumors. This is because CAR-T cells are typically delivered via IV infusions, but this approach struggles to concentrate enough CAR-T cells against solid tumors. Today, activating CAR-T cells against solid tumors entails exposure to toxic levels of cytokines.
* Stanford researchers developed a simple-to-make, injectable hydrogel to localize delivery and activation of CAR-T cells. This hydrogel houses both cytokines and CAR-T cells, allowing local and specific activation while minimizing toxicity to other tissues.
* The gel consists of water and two ingredients: biodegradable nanoparticles and Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), a commonly used polymer made from cellulose. When combined, the two components bind together like molecular Velcro. The gel’s mesh-like nature is tight enough to prevent cytokines from escaping yet weak enough for CAR-T cells to break free.

**Abstract**

Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) has proven to be highly effective in treating blood cancers, but traditional approaches to ACT are poorly effective in treating solid tumors observed clinically. Novel delivery methods for therapeutic cells have shown promise for treatment of solid tumors when compared with standard intravenous administration methods, but the few reported approaches leverage biomaterials that are complex to manufacture and have primarily demonstrated applicability following tumor resection or in immune-privileged tissues. Here, we engineer simple-to-implement injectable hydrogels for the controlled co-delivery of CAR-T cells and stimulatory cytokines that improve treatment of solid tumors. The unique architecture of this material simultaneously inhibits passive diffusion of entrapped cytokines and permits active motility of entrapped cells to enable long-term retention, viability, and activation of CAR-T cells. The generation of a transient inflammatory niche following administration affords sustained exposure of CAR-T cells, induces a tumor-reactive CAR-T phenotype, and improves efficacy of treatment.

**Abstract**

Metastatic breast cancer is a leading health burden worldwide. Previous studies have shown that metadherin (MTDH) promotes breast cancer initiation, metastasis and therapy resistance; however, the therapeutic potential of targeting MTDH remains largely unexplored. Here, we used genetically modified mice and demonstrate that genetic ablation of *Mtdh* inhibits breast cancer development through disrupting the interaction with staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing 1 (SND1), which is required to sustain breast cancer progression in established tumors. We performed a small-molecule compound screening to identify a class of specific inhibitors that disrupts the protein–protein interaction (PPI) between MTDH and SND1 and show that our lead candidate compounds C26-A2 and C26-A6 suppressed tumor growth and metastasis and enhanced chemotherapy sensitivity in preclinical models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Our results demonstrate a significant therapeutic potential in targeting the MTDH–SND1 complex and identify a new class of therapeutic agents for metastatic breast cancer.

In the study we just published in Nature Cancer, we developed C26-A6, a small chemical compound which is specifically toxic to cancer cells, but does no harm to normal cells, as far as we can observe. The next step, obviously, is to move it to humans.   


The current hurdle is that C26-A6 is not potent enough to be used in sufficiently small doses in human patients. We are currently trying to “optimize” it by developing molecules that are similar, but more potent. C26-A6 currently works at an effective concentration of about 1 uM. This effective concentration needs to be reduced substantially so that we can deliver an effective dose to human patients. We predict that this optimization work will take 2-3 years, using medicinal chemistry processes. If things go well, we will then prepare the application package for FDA approval to conduct human trials. This line of work is currently being done in Firebrand Therapeutics, a biotech startup I co-founded.  


Assuming we reach this stage (which itself can take several years), we will then have to manufacture it according to ""Good Manufacturing Practice"" standards. That takes at least a year and >$1 million. We need to perform toxicity and pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed and distributed in the body) in at least two different animal models. That takes 6-12 months and $1-2 million. Then we will apply for investigative new drug status (IND) from FDA and permission to start Phase I trials. Phase I might take a year or more. Then we need to show how the drug works compared to some standard treatment, which in a phase 3 trial in breast cancer takes 3 years and many hundreds of patients at least. Longer if you want to show it prolongs overall survival. Then the drug needs to be approved.  


Another approach is to develop something called “anti-sensen oligoes” against MTDH (published last year in Cancer Research), as an alternative way to target the same gene, if this small molecule approach doesn't succeed. We have collaborated with a German pharmaceutical company, Secarna, to make progress on this front, but again it will take at least 2-3 years before we get that treatment to the clinical trial stage. Manufacturing oligonucleotide drugs is is simpler and can be standardized, cutting the GMP manufacturing step to a few weeks instead of a year or more.  


Please rest assured that we are trying our best to make all these steps happen as quickly as possible. I know patients and their loved ones cannot wait.   


Meanwhile, please keep up the fight.  We are in this together.",4.820454299449921

**Abstract**

Metastatic breast cancer is a leading health burden worldwide. Previous studies have shown that metadherin (MTDH) promotes breast cancer initiation, metastasis and therapy resistance; however, the therapeutic potential of targeting MTDH remains largely unexplored. Here, we used genetically modified mice and demonstrate that genetic ablation of *Mtdh* inhibits breast cancer development through disrupting the interaction with staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing 1 (SND1), which is required to sustain breast cancer progression in established tumors. We performed a small-molecule compound screening to identify a class of specific inhibitors that disrupts the protein–protein interaction (PPI) between MTDH and SND1 and show that our lead candidate compounds C26-A2 and C26-A6 suppressed tumor growth and metastasis and enhanced chemotherapy sensitivity in preclinical models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Our results demonstrate a significant therapeutic potential in targeting the MTDH–SND1 complex and identify a new class of therapeutic agents for metastatic breast cancer.

In the study we just published in Nature Cancer, we developed C26-A6, a small chemical compound which is specifically toxic to cancer cells, but does no harm to normal cells, as far as we can observe. The next step, obviously, is to move it to humans.The current hurdle is that C26-A6 is not potent enough to be used in sufficiently small doses in human patients. 

We are currently trying to “optimize” it by developing molecules that are similar, but more potent. C26-A6 currently works at an effective concentration of about 1 uM. This effective concentration needs to be reduced substantially so that we can deliver an effective dose to human patients. We predict that this optimization work will take 2-3 years, using medicinal chemistry processes. If things go well, we will then prepare the application package for FDA approval to conduct human trials. This line of work is currently being done in Firebrand Therapeutics, a biotech startup I co-founded.

Assuming we reach this stage (which itself can take several years), we will then have to manufacture it according to ""Good Manufacturing Practice"" standards. That takes at least a year and >$1 million. We need to perform toxicity and pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed and distributed in the body) in at least two different animal models. That takes 6-12 months and $1-2 million. Then we will apply for investigative new drug status (IND) from FDA and permission to start Phase I trials. Phase I might take a year or more. Then we need to show how the drug works compared to some standard treatment, which in a phase 3 trial in breast cancer takes 3 years and many hundreds of patients at least. Longer if you want to show it prolongs overall survival. Then the drug needs to be approved.

Another approach is to develop something called “anti-sensen oligoes” against MTDH (published last year in Cancer Research), as an alternative way to target the same gene, if this small molecule approach doesn't succeed. We have collaborated with a German pharmaceutical company, Secarna, to make progress on this front, but again it will take at least 2-3 years before we get that treatment to the clinical trial stage. Manufacturing oligonucleotide drugs is is simpler and can be standardized, cutting the GMP manufacturing step to a few weeks instead of a year or more.

Please rest assured that we are trying our best to make all these steps happen as quickly as possible. I know patients and their loved ones cannot wait.

Meanwhile, please keep up the fight. We are in this together.",4.807520389556885

**Abstract**

Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major challenge in cancer treatment, and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) is an important target in the search for new MDR-reversing drugs. With the aim of discovering new potential BCRP inhibitors, the crude extract of leaves of *Eremophila galeata*, a plant endemic to Australia, was investigated for inhibitory activity of parental (HT29par) as well as BCRP-overexpressing HT29 colon cancer cells resistant to the chemotherapeutic SN-38 (i.e., HT29SN38 cells). This identified a fraction, eluted with 40% acetonitrile on a solid-phase extraction column, which showed weak growth-inhibitory activity on HT29SN38 cells when administered alone, but exhibited concentration-dependent growth inhibition when administered in combination with SN-38. The major constituent in this fraction was isolated and found to be 5,3',5'-trihydroxy-3,6,7,4'-tetramethoxyflavone (**2**), which at a concentration of 25 μg/mL potentiated the growth-inhibitory activity of SN-38 to a degree comparable to that of the known BCRP inhibitor Ko143 at 1 μM.

These results indicate that **2** acts synergistically with SN-38, with **2** being a BCRP efflux pump inhibitor while SN-38 inhibits topoisomerase-1.

r07uqv,cancerresearch,Novel evasion mechanism discovered: cancer cells can transfer mitochondria from immune cells to themselves via nanotubes,hotpot_ai,1637652771.0,"**Key Points**

* Harvard, MIT, and BYU researchers discovered a novel mechanism for cancer cells to evade the immune system: using nanotubes to steal mitochrondria from immune cells. This hijacking of mitochondria depleted immune cells while strengthening cancer cells.
* The researchers co-cultured breast cancer cells and immune cells then used field-emission scanning electron microscopy, fluorophore-tagged mitochondrial transfer tracing, and metabolic quantification to observe the transfer of mitochondria from immune cells to cancer cells, and the resulting impact on metabolism in both immune cells and cancer cells.
* Inhibiting the nanotube assembly machinery significantly reduced mitochondrial transfer and prevented the depletion of immune cells. This may form the basis for a novel treatment strategy.

**Abstract**

Cancer progresses by evading the immune system. Elucidating diverse immune evasion strategies is a critical step in the search for next-generation immunotherapies for cancer. Here we report that cancer cells can hijack the mitochondria from immune cells via physical nanotubes. Mitochondria are essential for metabolism and activation of immune cells. By using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, fluorophore-tagged mitochondrial transfer tracing and metabolic quantification, we demonstrate that the nanotube-mediated transfer of mitochondria from immune cells to cancer cells metabolically empowers the cancer cells and depletes the immune cells. Inhibiting the nanotube assembly machinery significantly reduced mitochondrial transfer and prevented the depletion of immune cells. Combining a farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase 1 inhibitor, namely, L-778123, which partially inhibited nanotube formation and mitochondrial transfer, with a programmed cell death protein 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor improved the antitumour outcomes in an aggressive immunocompetent breast cancer model. Nanotube-mediated mitochondrial hijacking can emerge as a novel target for developing next-generation immunotherapy agents for cancer.

qr8ya6,cancerresearch,Arginine enhances radiation therapy and may also help more broadly in anti-cancer therapy,hotpot_ai,1636592213.0,"**Key Points**

* Arginine delivered as an oral drug enhanced radiation therapy in patients with brain metastases. Tumors often produce high levels of nitric oxide (NO), which can be synthesized from arginine. 
* The findings also suggest arginine can serve as more than a radiosensitizer: arginine treatment could theoretically attack any tumor over-expressing NO-producing enzymes. Such tumors are common. The treatment induced metabolic changes in NO-dependent pathways, impairing cancer cells from repairing DNA damage caused by radiation while mostly sparing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.
* Reducing NO production could inhibit tumor growth but to date yields adverse side effects. The investigators hypothesized that boosting NO production -– via its precursor arginine –- might be beneficial, because while tumors can use NO to aid growth and survival, they must keep production below certain limits.

**Abstract**

Selected patients with brain metastases (BM) are candidates for radiotherapy. A lactatogenic metabolism, common in BM, has been associated with radioresistance. We demonstrated that BM express nitric oxide (NO) synthase 2 and that administration of its substrate L-arginine decreases tumor lactate in BM patients. In a placebo-controlled trial, we showed that administration of L-arginine before each fraction enhanced the effect of radiation, improving the control of BM. Studies in preclinical models demonstrated that L-arginine radiosensitization is a NO-mediated mechanism secondary to the metabolic adaptation induced in cancer cells. We showed that the decrease in tumor lactate was a consequence of reduced glycolysis that also impacted ATP and NAD+ levels. These effects were associated with NO-dependent inhibition of GAPDH and hyperactivation of PARP upon nitrosative DNA damage. These metabolic changes ultimately impaired the repair of DNA damage induced by radiation in cancer cells while greatly sparing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.

**Background**

* Arginine, also called L-arginine, is inexpensive and widely available, generally considered safe, and can get from the bloodstream into the brain relatively easily. The idea of using it to treat cancer arose from observations that tumors often aid their own survival by producing high levels of the related molecule nitric oxide (NO). The latter regulates multiple processes in the body, including the flow of blood through blood vessels; tumor cells often make more NO by upregulating their production of special enzymes called NO synthases, which synthesize NO from arginine.
* NO regulates multiple processes in the body, including the flow of blood, and often promotes carcinogenic growth.",,,,,4.680865049362183

1elynfu,alzheimers,Help - Brain Glucose Hypometabolism?,tway11-33,1722992432.0,"Today my dad (age 74) was diagnosed with brain glucose hypometabolism after a PET/CT scan. If I understand correctly, it is a neurodegenerative issue caused by aging and his diabetes. Essentially, it’s a type of dementia, and it can be associated with Alzheimer’s and Parkinsons. 
He had been to various doctors (cardiologists, endocrinologists, neuro specialists, ENT specialists) over the past year and had ruled out Parkinson’s. 
His symptoms include mental confusion, forgetting words, poor sleep (including somnambulism/sleepwalking), blurry vision, and struggling to complete everyday tasks.
Following his diagnosis, he started taking donepezil chlorhydrate 5mg. 

Have any of you dealt with brain glucose hypometabolism in your families?
Is there anything (treatments, lifestyle changes, logistics) that helped them manage their diagnosis?
If you feel comfortable sharing, how did your LO’s brain glucose hypometabolism progress? For example, what type of symptom progression did you notice? What was the timeline of that progression?

She’s 68 and still full of life. She’s barely showing any symptoms, so she’s a great candidate for the medication minus the fact she’s a double apoe4 carrier.

1e9ckdi,alzheimers,Alzheimer's treatment w/ Leqembi for European patient,Axolotl7887,1721649832.0,"Hi all,

My mother (56) was diagnosed with an atypical type of Alzheimer's, Posterior Cortical Atrophy, back in December 2021. We are from a nordic country and thus have been waiting, as I'm sure have many others in this subreddit, for the European Medical Agency to approve Eisai/Biogen's Leqembi (lecanemab) or even Lilly's Kisunla (donanemab - although I take it this one was only just approved in the US and will take quite a while to get to Europe). Her attending doctor wanted to put her on lecanemab and was convinced it would be approved by June latest, which has not happened. We are therefore looking into other avenues of getting her the treatment because we have realised that we really cannot wait for, say, another year to start on this. However she might react to it, this feels like our only chance, and she herself has decided that she wants to do it. Her doctor is also in agreement with us, if there is an opportunity to get treatment elsewhere, because they think she would be a good candidate for it.

Now I am wondering whether anyone knows of a way in which we could get her put on the treatment. We are in contact with some US clinics, but travelling to the US and being there for the duration of the treatment would be extraordinarily complicated for us. I know Leqembi is also approved in Israel, and that technically the UK medical agency is independent of the EMA, but I'm not sure whether there is an opportunity there. I also don't know whether places like Russia, for example, are an option. Does anyone have experience with being treated with Leqembi as a patient from Europe? Is there a way to access it from a closer country? I know that in the UK (where my parents lived for a while) doctors could technically prescribe yet-to-be-approved medicines if they deemed it necessary. But again, we have zero experience with this and would really appreciate any insight into something like this. This includes private clinics or anything of the like, anywhere in Europe – we're happy to bear the financial costs as necessary, but just don't even know where to begin looking. 

I appreciate that this is a difficult question given that the EMA has not approved it yet, but thought it worth a post in case there is something out there. It also looks like the EMA *will* approve it at some point relatively soon, but it is also a question of relying on our hospital's ability to be logistically ready to administer the medicine soon after approval, which we are not very confident in. Thus even private clinics where there is, say, a waiting list and where patients will be able obtain the treatment as soon as it is approved would be great. If anyone knows of something like this please do let me know.

Any tips/recommendations on this are welcome (but please do respect the topic of the question and our decision to try and find other avenues for treatment – no need to comment in order to debate whether she should, or should not, try to get it, whether the hospital will be ready to administer it on time etc.). Grateful for any information you think might be helpful.",,,,,4.680865049362183
1e7wp6g,alzheimers,Doctor said may be something other than Alz,ktwbc,1721485137.0,"Had a followup neuro appointment today. My partner was diagnosed at a neurologist a couple of years ago in Austin with Alzheimers, which seemed to be really a diagnosis through process of elimination. They did an MRI, checked for tumors, did bloodwork, did the extensive memory tests (like a 2 hour appointment that day), etc, and came back with ""we've ruled out everything else"", so we think it's Alzheimers. 

  
The neurologist today started asking questions because his patterns and issues don't quite fit the traditional model of Alz (which is something that I found myself saying to my family in conversations too). Most of what I've read is that Alzheimers patients for a long time are physically okay, it's just memory and forgetting and mixing up things for quite a long time. He's seemed to be much more affected with physical issues along with memory, and even the memory issues are can't remember or can't imagine a physical task in his mind like how to fold a shirt, but he's never mixed up people, or suddenly say something as if it's the past.

So the neurologist today starts asking exactly what the first people did to test or confirm his diagnosis (and our answers seem to lead to the point that they didn't do everything they were supposed to). And she menttions that he may have another type of dementia, like Lewy Body, or even Parkinsons with dementia because of how he walks and has physical issues. And now we have all new appointments for specialists, and I feel like all that testing we did now we get to start all over, and while we want to know what we're dealing with, we also don't know how much of a difference it's going to make. On some level, it's all flavors of dementia, the drug treatments are the same, so how much difference is that going to make.

The doctor here seems much more trustworthy and the medical facilities are bigger and nicer. The place in Austin looked like a 1970s wood paneling office and very low-rent, so it's very easy to see they weren't very good, or didn't care enough to follow through, so we do seem to be getting better treatment here. I just feel bad for him because there's a sense of ""We have to go through all this again"" with the unending tests, and to what end....

1clmbxv,RetatrutideTrial,MORE Retatrutide trials are enrolling! ,RunningFNP,1715010473.0,"Hey everyone! I figured this can serve as an update what's happening in the retatrutide clinical trial world! Those of you in the Triumph phase 3 trials, we were the first but now Eli Lilly announced with their Q1 2024 earnings that they are expanding retatrutide trials to include even more indications and treatment comparisons. 

So I figured I’d make a list of what they’re looking at and my thoughts on each trial. As always if you’re looking to enroll in a trial or see if one is close to you, use Eli Lilly’s webpage, https://trials.lilly.com/en-US/find?x_st=1 or goto clinicaltrials.gov and search for retatrutide that way. Onto the trials!

First up- 

TRIUMPH-OUTCOMES

J1I-MC-GZBO - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06383390
The main purpose of this study is to determine if retatrutide can significantly lower the incidence of serious heart-related complications or prevent the worsening of kidney function. The trial will enroll adults with body mass index 27 kg/m^2 or higher and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease and/or chronic kidney disease.

This is the biggest trial so far of retatrutide, it will include at least 10,000 patients and last 5 years total! This trial excites me the most as a current nurse practitioner because they’re looking at both cardiovascular AND kidney health in this trial to see if it can help both. There are some hints in other research that glucagon agonism can help with renal function, blood pressure and chronic kidney disease in a direct manner as glucagon receptors are found in the kidney. 


From the biggest to the smallest trial in the group we have this trial next:

J1I-MC-GZBW - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06313528
The main purpose of the study is to look at the effect of the study drug compared to placebo on calorie intake, energy metabolism, and appetite.

This is a phase 1 trial and only enrolling 75 patients. It’s pretty self-explanatory, they’re trying to figure out how retatrutide increases energy metabolism, caloric intake and appetite. This study is important because we know in rodent models that retatrutide directly increases daily energy expenditure(aka it causes your body to burn more calories at baseline) but this effect has been difficult to measure in humans, looks like Eli Lilly is going to try and give a try to figure this bit out. 

Next up is the TRANSCEND-T2D Phase 3 trials. These trials are all looking at diabetics specifically, there is Transcend 1, 2 and 3. Here’s all 3 trials and what each is looking for:

J1I-MC-GZBY - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06354660
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of retatrutide compared with placebo in participants with Type 2 Diabetes and inadequate glycemic control.
 
J1I-MC-GZBZ - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06260722
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of retatrutide compared with semaglutide in participants with Type 2 Diabetes and inadequate glycemic control with metformin with or without sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i).

J1I-MC-GZQA - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06297603
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of retatrutide compared with placebo in participants with Type 2 Diabetes and renal impairment, with inadequate glycemic control on basal insulin alone or a combination of basal insulin with or without metformin and/or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor.

All of these trials are basically looking at diabetes from multiple angles, one compares it to Ozempic to determine if retatrutide is better(spoiler alert, it will be) another looks at it compared to diet and exercise alone, and finally the last is looking at diabetics with kidney disease(again trying to see if it helps!) 

Finally the last study in our list is a phase 2 study 

J1I-MC-GZBU - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT05936151
The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of retatrutide on renal function in participants with overweight or obesity and chronic kidney disease (CKD), with or without Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).

Again this trial is looking at kidney function in both diabetics and non-diabetics to see if retatrutide can help treat and/or preserve kidney function in patients with chronic kidney disease. 

So that’s it, exciting times ahead and I imagine we will get an influx of new folks in the coming months starting in these new trials. I especially imagine the TRIUMPH-OUTCOMES trial will definitely increase our numbers just on sheer volume alone! Let’s keep it friendly and helpful for all that come our way!

TRIUMPH-OUTCOMES

J1I-MC-GZBO - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06383390
The main purpose of this study is to determine if retatrutide can significantly lower the incidence of serious heart-related complications or prevent the worsening of kidney function. The trial will enroll adults with body mass index 27 kg/m^2 or higher and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease and/or chronic kidney disease.

This is the biggest trial so far of retatrutide, it will include at least 10,000 patients and last 5 years total! This trial excites me the most as a current nurse practitioner because they’re looking at both cardiovascular AND kidney health in this trial to see if it can help both. There are some hints in other research that glucagon agonism can help with renal function, blood pressure and chronic kidney disease in a direct manner as glucagon receptors are found in the kidney. 


From the biggest to the smallest trial in the group we have this trial next:

J1I-MC-GZBW - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06313528
The main purpose of the study is to look at the effect of the study drug compared to placebo on calorie intake, energy metabolism, and appetite.

This is a phase 1 trial and only enrolling 75 patients. It’s pretty self-explanatory, they’re trying to figure out how retatrutide increases energy metabolism, caloric intake and appetite. This study is important because we know in rodent models that retatrutide directly increases daily energy expenditure(aka it causes your body to burn more calories at baseline) but this effect has been difficult to measure in humans, looks like Eli Lilly is going to try and give a try to figure this bit out. 

Next up is the TRANSCEND-T2D Phase 3 trials. These trials are all looking at diabetics specifically, there is Transcend 1, 2 and 3. Here’s all 3 trials and what each is looking for:

J1I-MC-GZBY - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06354660
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of retatrutide compared with placebo in participants with Type 2 Diabetes and inadequate glycemic control.
 
J1I-MC-GZBZ - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06260722
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of retatrutide compared with semaglutide in participants with Type 2 Diabetes and inadequate glycemic control with metformin with or without sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i).

J1I-MC-GZQA - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06297603
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of retatrutide compared with placebo in participants with Type 2 Diabetes and renal impairment, with inadequate glycemic control on basal insulin alone or a combination of basal insulin with or without metformin and/or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor.

All of these trials are basically looking at diabetes from multiple angles, one compares it to Ozempic to determine if retatrutide is better(spoiler alert, it will be) another looks at it compared to diet and exercise alone, and finally the last is looking at diabetics with kidney disease(again trying to see if it helps!) 

Finally the last study in our list is a phase 2 study 

J1I-MC-GZBU - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT05936151
The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of retatrutide on renal function in participants with overweight or obesity and chronic kidney disease (CKD), with or without Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).

Again this trial is looking at kidney function in both diabetics and non-diabetics to see if retatrutide can help treat and/or preserve kidney function in patients with chronic kidney disease. 

So that’s it, exciting times ahead and I imagine we will get an influx of new folks in the coming months starting in these new trials. I especially imagine the TRIUMPH-OUTCOMES trial will definitely increase our numbers just on sheer volume alone! Let’s keep it friendly and helpful for all that come our way!

I was told that I was not chosen because my labs show no history of cardiovascular vascular events and that chronically kidney disease alone was not enough to qualify. This is disappointing.",4.788272678852081

Those of you in the Triumph phase 3 trials, we were the first but now Eli Lilly announced with their Q1 2024 earnings that they are expanding retatrutide trials to include even more indications and treatment comparisons. 

So I figured I’d make a list of what they’re looking at and my thoughts on each trial.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of retatrutide compared with placebo in participants with Type 2 Diabetes and inadequate glycemic control.
 
J1I-MC-GZBZ - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06260722
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of retatrutide compared with semaglutide in participants with Type 2 Diabetes and inadequate glycemic control with metformin with or without sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i).

J1I-MC-GZQA - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06297603
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of retatrutide compared with placebo in participants with Type 2 Diabetes and renal impairment, with inadequate glycemic control on basal insulin alone or a combination of basal insulin with or without metformin and/or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor.

All of these trials are basically looking at diabetes from multiple angles, one compares it to Ozempic to determine if retatrutide is better(spoiler alert, it will be) another looks at it compared to diet and exercise alone, and finally the last is looking at diabetics with kidney disease(again trying to see if it helps!) 

Finally the last study in our list is a phase 2 study 

J1I-MC-GZBU - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT05936151
The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of retatrutide on renal function in participants with overweight or obesity and chronic kidney disease (CKD), with or without Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).

Again this trial is looking at kidney function in both diabetics and non-diabetics to see if retatrutide can help treat and/or preserve kidney function in patients with chronic kidney disease. 

So that’s it, exciting times ahead and I imagine we will get an influx of new folks in the coming months starting in these new trials. I especially imagine the TRIUMPH-OUTCOMES trial will definitely increase our numbers just on sheer volume alone! Let’s keep it friendly and helpful for all that come our way!

First up- 

TRIUMPH-OUTCOMES

J1I-MC-GZBO - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06383390
The main purpose of this study is to determine if retatrutide can significantly lower the incidence of serious heart-related complications or prevent the worsening of kidney function. The trial will enroll adults with body mass index 27 kg/m^2 or higher and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease and/or chronic kidney disease.

This is the biggest trial so far of retatrutide, it will include at least 10,000 patients and last 5 years total! This trial excites me the most as a current nurse practitioner because they’re looking at both cardiovascular AND kidney health in this trial to see if it can help both. There are some hints in other research that glucagon agonism can help with renal function, blood pressure and chronic kidney disease in a direct manner as glucagon receptors are found in the kidney. 


From the biggest to the smallest trial in the group we have this trial next:

J1I-MC-GZBW - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06313528
The main purpose of the study is to look at the effect of the study drug compared to placebo on calorie intake, energy metabolism, and appetite.

This is a phase 1 trial and only enrolling 75 patients. It’s pretty self-explanatory, they’re trying to figure out how retatrutide increases energy metabolism, caloric intake and appetite. This study is important because we know in rodent models that retatrutide directly increases daily energy expenditure(aka it causes your body to burn more calories at baseline) but this effect has been difficult to measure in humans, looks like Eli Lilly is going to try and give a try to figure this bit out.

Those of you in the Triumph phase 3 trials, we were the first but now Eli Lilly announced with their Q1 2024 earnings that they are expanding retatrutide trials to include even more indications and treatment comparisons. 

So I figured I’d make a list of what they’re looking at and my thoughts on each trial. As always if you’re looking to enroll in a trial or see if one is close to you, use Eli Lilly’s webpage, https://trials.lilly.com/en-US/find?x_st=1 or goto clinicaltrials.gov and search for retatrutide that way. Onto the trials!

First up- 

TRIUMPH-OUTCOMES

J1I-MC-GZBO - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06383390
The main purpose of this study is to determine if retatrutide can significantly lower the incidence of serious heart-related complications or prevent the worsening of kidney function. The trial will enroll adults with body mass index 27 kg/m^2 or higher and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease and/or chronic kidney disease.

This is the biggest trial so far of retatrutide, it will include at least 10,000 patients and last 5 years total! This trial excites me the most as a current nurse practitioner because they’re looking at both cardiovascular AND kidney health in this trial to see if it can help both. There are some hints in other research that glucagon agonism can help with renal function, blood pressure and chronic kidney disease in a direct manner as glucagon receptors are found in the kidney. 


From the biggest to the smallest trial in the group we have this trial next:

J1I-MC-GZBW - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06313528
The main purpose of the study is to look at the effect of the study drug compared to placebo on calorie intake, energy metabolism, and appetite.

This is a phase 1 trial and only enrolling 75 patients. It’s pretty self-explanatory, they’re trying to figure out how retatrutide increases energy metabolism, caloric intake and appetite. This study is important because we know in rodent models that retatrutide directly increases daily energy expenditure(aka it causes your body to burn more calories at baseline) but this effect has been difficult to measure in humans, looks like Eli Lilly is going to try and give a try to figure this bit out. 

Next up is the TRANSCEND-T2D Phase 3 trials. These trials are all looking at diabetics specifically, there is Transcend 1, 2 and 3. Here’s all 3 trials and what each is looking for:

J1I-MC-GZBY - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06354660
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of retatrutide compared with placebo in participants with Type 2 Diabetes and inadequate glycemic control.
 
J1I-MC-GZBZ - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06260722
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of retatrutide compared with semaglutide in participants with Type 2 Diabetes and inadequate glycemic control with metformin with or without sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i).

J1I-MC-GZQA - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06297603
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of retatrutide compared with placebo in participants with Type 2 Diabetes and renal impairment, with inadequate glycemic control on basal insulin alone or a combination of basal insulin with or without metformin and/or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor.

All of these trials are basically looking at diabetes from multiple angles, one compares it to Ozempic to determine if retatrutide is better(spoiler alert, it will be) another looks at it compared to diet and exercise alone, and finally the last is looking at diabetics with kidney disease(again trying to see if it helps!) 

Finally the last study in our list is a phase 2 study 

J1I-MC-GZBU - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT05936151
The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of retatrutide on renal function in participants with overweight or obesity and chronic kidney disease (CKD), with or without Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).

Again this trial is looking at kidney function in both diabetics and non-diabetics to see if retatrutide can help treat and/or preserve kidney function in patients with chronic kidney disease. 

So that’s it, exciting times ahead and I imagine we will get an influx of new folks in the coming months starting in these new trials. I especially imagine the TRIUMPH-OUTCOMES trial will definitely increase our numbers just on sheer volume alone! Let’s keep it friendly and helpful for all that come our way!

J1I-MC-GZBW - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06313528
The main purpose of the study is to look at the effect of the study drug compared to placebo on calorie intake, energy metabolism, and appetite.

This is a phase 1 trial and only enrolling 75 patients. It’s pretty self-explanatory, they’re trying to figure out how retatrutide increases energy metabolism, caloric intake and appetite. This study is important because we know in rodent models that retatrutide directly increases daily energy expenditure(aka it causes your body to burn more calories at baseline) but this effect has been difficult to measure in humans, looks like Eli Lilly is going to try and give a try to figure this bit out. 

Next up is the TRANSCEND-T2D Phase 3 trials. These trials are all looking at diabetics specifically, there is Transcend 1, 2 and 3. Here’s all 3 trials and what each is looking for:

J1I-MC-GZBY - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06354660
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of retatrutide compared with placebo in participants with Type 2 Diabetes and inadequate glycemic control.
 
J1I-MC-GZBZ - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06260722
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of retatrutide compared with semaglutide in participants with Type 2 Diabetes and inadequate glycemic control with metformin with or without sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i).

J1I-MC-GZQA - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06297603
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of retatrutide compared with placebo in participants with Type 2 Diabetes and renal impairment, with inadequate glycemic control on basal insulin alone or a combination of basal insulin with or without metformin and/or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor.

All of these trials are basically looking at diabetes from multiple angles, one compares it to Ozempic to determine if retatrutide is better(spoiler alert, it will be) another looks at it compared to diet and exercise alone, and finally the last is looking at diabetics with kidney disease(again trying to see if it helps!) 

Finally the last study in our list is a phase 2 study 

J1I-MC-GZBU - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT05936151
The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of retatrutide on renal function in participants with overweight or obesity and chronic kidney disease (CKD), with or without Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).

Again this trial is looking at kidney function in both diabetics and non-diabetics to see if retatrutide can help treat and/or preserve kidney function in patients with chronic kidney disease. 

So that’s it, exciting times ahead and I imagine we will get an influx of new folks in the coming months starting in these new trials. I especially imagine the TRIUMPH-OUTCOMES trial will definitely increase our numbers just on sheer volume alone! Let’s keep it friendly and helpful for all that come our way!

1clmbxv,RetatrutideTrial,MORE Retatrutide trials are enrolling! ,RunningFNP,1715010473.0,"Hey everyone! I figured this can serve as an update what's happening in the retatrutide clinical trial world! Those of you in the Triumph phase 3 trials, we were the first but now Eli Lilly announced with their Q1 2024 earnings that they are expanding retatrutide trials to include even more indications and treatment comparisons. 

So I figured I’d make a list of what they’re looking at and my thoughts on each trial. As always if you’re looking to enroll in a trial or see if one is close to you, use Eli Lilly’s webpage, https://trials.lilly.com/en-US/find?x_st=1 or goto clinicaltrials.gov and search for retatrutide that way. Onto the trials!

First up- 

TRIUMPH-OUTCOMES

J1I-MC-GZBO - ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT06383390
The main purpose of this study is to determine if retatrutide can significantly lower the incidence of serious heart-related complications or prevent the worsening of kidney function. The trial will enroll adults with body mass index 27 kg/m^2 or higher and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease and/or chronic kidney disease.

This is the biggest trial so far of retatrutide, it will include at least 10,000 patients and last 5 years total! This trial excites me the most as a current nurse practitioner because they’re looking at both cardiovascular AND kidney health in this trial to see if it can help both. There are some hints in other research that glucagon agonism can help with renal function, blood pressure and chronic kidney disease in a direct manner as glucagon receptors are found in the kidney.

Amazing achievement. 
Looks like you’re sitting in my timeline.  

I started beginning of March, week 22 now. Box 6, just took pen 2.  
Currently down 28kg.  
Like others have said, once you get down to 22bmi, they will certainly do a dose reduction. And I think at 20bmi, your off the trial.   
I’m currently a tad worried as I still have 40weeks to go, but can physically only really afford to lose another 5kg. Once I lose this amount, I actually don’t want to be on it anymore.  As there is nothing else to achieve

I think this is the hardest phase of the trial and weight loss in general. I don’t know how long our bodies will fight for homeostasis, but that’s what we are against to now and when the trial is over. 
I am back to my weight from 22 summers ago, and I’m not sure my body remembers how to be that size. One thing I do know though is that once we have pushed a certain limit (in size) our bodies seem to have a “memory” of sorts that tries to find that limit again. I’m saying this as a woman that has experienced a rapid 40-50 lbs weight gain and loss due to pregnancy, twice. But I think we can also see that in folks that have had weight-loss surgeries, the success rate of maintaining weight loss for 10 years is only 50%. A doctor once told my friend that excess skin removal should count as part of the overall treatment to stop “the body to fill in the available space.” Take that for what is worth, but I think he’s right. 
Anyway, great job keeping up with the protein intake and exercise. I haven’t been great on that and I have experienced some muscle loss. Your progress is inspiring and I hope you continue to thrive in this journey!",4.679865300655365

For me, it was alkaline phosphatate that became a concern. 

My last dose was 4/26; I've been on hold since then. I've been going to weekly unscheduled visits for bloodwork,  had a CT scan through the study, I've seen my GI and had a US and more bloodwork, and had my annual physical with more bloodwork.  

My liver numbers are all back to normal now, and I'm really hoping to start dosing again. My clinic PA said if the study doctor agrees, I'd start back on 4mg and work my way up again. 

Sadly, I've gained back 10 to 12 pounds from losing 70. I'm hungry,  I don't feel full like I used to, and my cravings are back. I need to get back on the medication!",4.7834678292274475

I also had an ultrasound immediately and am seeing the liver specialist in August.

But I wanted to comment on cravings that I've found it possible to retrain cravings.   Which makes sense, different countries have different diets, but the humans living in various countries don't actually have different DNA, the diet is just culturally learned.

So, I've been able to be on an arc, where I cut out all processed foods, cut out all simple carbs, cut out anything with sugar added of course - I will just call it a Mediterranean diet, and thereafter for a couple years not crave the bad foods.   What happens eventually with me, is someone convinces me to have a donut or a coke, or something, and then the desire to have another donut or coke is immense.  Then I go on another arc of obesity for several years.

I've been normal weight and obese and I go through these periods back and forth.  We can call it yo-yo, but I will be normal weight for several years.  Some people say you can have addictive foods in moderation, but that isn't true for me, addictive foods always set me back on a bad path.

Anyway, for me this has absolutely nothing to do with metabolism and can even be accomplished without GLP1, but I am on GLP1 right now, and it allowed me to reset my diet like never before, it was the most effective tool I have ever had for resetting my diet.

But ultimately, based on previous life experience, for me, I know that it won't be 'the same' if I leave GLP1 but it also won't immediately mean regaining - the key is to never adopt the American diet again...especially sugar spikes, they lead to more sugar craving and nothing good.

My concern for many people on say, sema ,is that with sema they can have a  half donut and not eat the rest of it. But if they maintain that habit, when they leave the sema, that will no longer be true.  This is the moment to get on the different diet train, but because their life experience is different than mine, they don't see the opportunity

anyway, I literally plan to go off the GLP1, have that arc of a year or two at normal weight, and if I get in a bad way again, start the GLP1 again.  Now that I know about it ,no reason to not use it.",4.770666718482971

Here you are, a person who is doing it right, lifting weights, working on nutrition, and you aren't feeling supported.  Such great behaviors should be absolutely supported. 

anyway, I know nothing about this sub, but, I just want to say  my experience with other GLP1 subs is they are, not surprisingly, a society of overweight people.  And sometimes in the cadre of overweight and obese people, are those that don't really follow good nutrition and exercise plans, and they rigorously defend that choice.

For me, I will be searching a nutrition and exercise support forum, maybe it doesn't have to do anything with GLP1....whatever it takes, I think everyone has to have the right type of support.  I do not find many of the GLP1 forums to be positive or beneficial, to be frank.",4.418368339538574

The following month they reduced my dose to the previous month and then per protocol they took me back up to the dose I struggled on the next month.

The first four months it’s escalation so it pretty easy to work out. And the doctors note down if the client is ok to proceed up , stay on current dose or in extreme cases move down. So once against it’s straightforward to work out . The hardest part is know if you stayed on the 9mg or moved up to 12mg, but once again you should be able to tell with increase side effects increase weight loss.

And you say some people don’t have the knowledge. Well that’s pretty stupid, they go  blindly signing the forms, injection an experimental drug into their body without doing any research beforehand. But I guess when people are desperate, they will do anything.

Use the spreadsheet I made up to work out where you should be at various intervals. Then you’ll know which one your on Be aware the results are the means average, based on 110kg starting weight, but they don’t change that much at different starting weights either.

Also, the “only” way they can  treat side effects is by REDUCING THE DOSE, or SKIPPING the dose. That’s it, there is no other way.

As someone that had their dose decreased for a month I was very grateful. The previous month was terrible and I almost quit. I was so sick. They had me skip a dose for a week and I was terrified the following month when they increased it back to the dose I had struggled on so much. However, my body finally adjusted and I had milder symptoms in comparison to what it had been. I would venture to say it increased 1 more time after that but honestly I don’t know. My symptoms have been sporadic which is what makes it challenging to know and track. 

Last month I was mostly good except for a week and a half where it felt like the intensity of symptoms returned with a vengeance. I’ve been reading a lot about gut health so over the last few months I’ve tried to make and tweak dietary changes to provide maximum support for my microbiome as best as possible. I even used microbiome mapping to assist in the process. I understood my symptoms had put everything off balance and needed to be fixed but without medication. So I took control of the only thing I could…what and how I was eating which isn’t easy because I am not hungry. I’ve got it mostly sorted now but with the changes I don’t know if I am at the max dose or the one below it. It’s one of the two and I’d guess the one below the max solely going off of reactions and symptoms. It’s just not clear cut like it was.",4.816118657588959

Yeah I started Reta recently and have found it allows much more weight loss than the trials say (when trying to) simply due to the appetite suppressing effects, always feeling full and lower interest in food

I've done /r/intermittentfasting a bunch of times without any drugs so i'm no stranger to eating once per day

Reta is like being in peak IF phase and _still_ having little to no hunger the entire day, next level for sure

In month 3 (November) I was sick practically the entire month with raging nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and extreme fatigue and muscle pain.

My current symptoms (have been constant for the last 5 months) are constipation, mild nausea, muscle pain  
(mainly in my legs), fatigue, and being cold all the f'ing time. Overall, I feel that it has been worth it, but I wish the dosing could have increased at a much slower pace. I have struggled with eating enough food, especially protein, and getting in physical activity more than just walking has been impossible. 

I also really dislike my trial site. They have been so unhelpful and seem very disorganized. My appointments end up taking 2+ hours, but I spend less than 15 minutes being seen by anyone. They refused to write me a prescription for Zofran during the worst of my nausea. I was told ""the doctor does not feel comfortable writing you a prescription as you are not his patient."" They told me two months ago that if I was still having symptoms that maybe I just wasn't cut out for the drug and needed to drop out. They also told me I couldn't skip a dose to space out my doses for an upcoming vacation as it would ""mess up the paperwork and Eli Lilly might end up dropping me."" I mentioned this reddit group and they got very defensive and told me to be careful getting any advice from the internet. I feel so unsupported by all of them and really wish they were willing to work with me. But ultimately, they know they have the upper hand because this drug is truly lifechanging and with all the shortages for other GLP-1's, I'm not likely to go anywhere.

These drugs are truly a miracle. I've struggled with obesity my entire life, tried every diet program on the market, gained and lost the same 80-100 pounds multiple times.

1d7p8au,RetatrutideTrial,Triumph 4 (Knee Osteoarthritis) – 24 week update,notyouroldlady,1717477582.0,"F55, SW82.6kg (182lb), CW 70.9kg (156lb), GW 68.5kg (151lb)

I’m roughly 6 months into the Retatrutide trial for arthritis of the knee.  This trial requires a starting BMI of 27 or more, as well as knee osteoarthritis of level 2 or 3 (out of a 4). There are three randomised groups – placebo, max dose 9mg & max dose 12mg. I’m pretty confident that I’m in the 12mg group. I’m not in the US.

I had my initial visit in late November and was randomised (received first dose of the meds) in mid-December. The appetite suppression started immediately. I’ve been losing ½ kg (1lb) every week pretty consistently. At 6 months in, I’m very close to my goal weight but I’m hoping to slow down the loss a little so that I can stay on the meds as long as possible, giving my body the best possible chance to accept my new weight as normal.

Now I’m going to talk about the side effects, of which I have suffered many.  However, if you are taking this medication outside of a trial, or are hoping to in the future, please remember that you will be taking a dose that is appropriate for you personally, whereas I am taking the dose based on the trial protocols. Under those circumstances, I imagine I would have titrated up more slowly and stayed at a lower dose. Also, I have had IBS all my life and it can be hard to separate IBS from Reta side effects. Here are the miseries I have suffered on my way to a healthy weight.

Constipation/diarrhoea – This started immediately from my first dose. I was pretty uncomfortable in the first week. Movicol helped.

Fire skin – The skin burning started in the early weeks.  At first I felt it mostly on my forearms, but it’s moved around my body since then. Now I mostly notice it when I’m cold and I get goosebumps.

Cold – The cold hit me at about 3 months in.  On the first day, I couldn’t stop shivering. My body temperature was down around 35C (95F). Once I started drinking electrolytes (I recommend LMNT or Thorzt), this got much better, but I am still colder in general than I used to be.

Sleep disturbances – This is worst in the early mornings. My stomach/bowel (whatever, I’m not a doctor) wakes up as early as 3am and I often can’t get back to sleep. This happens maybe twice a week and I think it’s related to when I’ve taken the med, on about day 2 or 3.

Racing heart rate – I’ve had a few times where my heart rate just goes nuts, up to 130 or so. And overall, my resting heart rate has increased from an average of 68 before the trial to currently 84. I don’t really notice this, and it doesn’t bother me.

Nausea/vomiting – This kicked in when I hit 9mg, so about 4 months into the trial. I had a very bad experience with overeating – trust me you don’t need the details.  For my first month on 12mg, I vomited constantly and really felt quite ill.  My loved ones worried about me.  When I went into the clinic, they were alarmed at how poorly I looked.  I suppose I hadn’t realised how bad it was. Anyway, they gave me anti-nausea meds which made a HUGE difference. I had Ondansetron, which was not very helpful, and metoclopramide (Maxalon) which was. I’m reliant on that now. When the Maxalon wears off, the nausea kicks in.

Dry mouth/bad breath – My mouth was dry for several months, although it seems to have eased a bit now. My partner commented one day that my breath smelled like camphor, and I Googled “mothball breath” to discover that it’s a real thing, and it’s to do with a bacterium that grows in a dry mouth. I did buy some mouthwash, but I have trouble using it because it makes me vomit.

Low blood pressure/dizziness – My BP tends toward low anyway, but I did have a few precipitous dips, and I’d get dizzy standing up. My job involves standing in front of people talking and I found myself having to drag over a chair. I manage this by trying to keep some food down and keeping up with the electrolytes.

Tiredness – I know some people talk about feeling energetic on Reta, but I have not. I’m generally a bit tired on it, but with all the disturbed sleep and vomiting, it could also be a side effect of the side effects. I’ve also just started taking a multivitamin.

The first month on (assumed) 12mg was very rough for me, and so the clinic had me take a week off at the start of the following month.  I’m also about to go on holidays (vacation) so I’m taking another two weeks off.  Apparently, it shouldn’t be a bit shock to go back on after that. Shortly after that I will likely hit BMI 22.5, and then I’ll have to deviate from the study protocols. They can put me back to 9mg or they might take me off completely, but I can stay in the trial to see the dietician and have regular health checks. I am very nervous about coming off the medication, but I’m increasing my exercise in the hope of building more muscle which will help keep my weight down in future.

But, I hear you ask, what about the arthritis? Well, I’m pleased to say that the reduction in pain and stiffness was slow to kick in, but now I’m delighted with the state of my knees. I’m much more mobile, I even slowly jogged about 100 metres a couple of days back. That was unimaginable 6 months ago.

Despite the misery, I am so happy to have lucked my way onto this trial. (I just happened to be seeing the trial doctor for another issue and he noticed the arthritis in my medical history.) I get quite emotional when I think about the millions of people who are going to be helped by this. ",l71ezk1,Aussie_Mopar,1717492185.0,"Congrats.
I’m on the same trial.
And in the same country Australia (it was easy to tell where you were from by your words too 🤣😂)
I’m now 13weeks in, down 18kg.
Will be having pen two from box 4 (9mg) tomorrow.
 
By your write up I can relate perfectly with the sleep issue. The first 1-3nights after injection I wake around 3am and that’s it, I can’t sleep anymore. Has been like this since day 1.
And the second thing is the resting HR. Previously it was sitting around 70bpm, After injection it rises a good 20bmp. Once in awhile it will spike to 100-115 while doing nothing too.
I had very very slight nausea through box two, but that was it.
Must say box three (6mg) and the first shot from box 4 (9mg) have been a bit of a let down actually. I was expecting to get these side effects and nothing. Oh except the feeling of not being hungry and the mental side of not wanting to eat or reach for junk food.

You do realise each & every visit to the clinic they can easily decide to not bump you up if your in escalation phase. And they can easily bump you down too if your experience side effects. Didn’t really matter how mild they are either.
Regarding getting down to 22BMI. Yes they can and in most cases will 
Stop the trial. But it up to each clinic to  decide. 
Getting down to 22 BMI is nothing I have to worry as I don’t want to get that low 🤣😂

I really appreciate your honesty and the depth into which you describe your experiences and that while all of this is exciting, there are certainly side effects and other things to consider. 

I think you're absolutely right that in the real world we would not titrate up so fast. I have the same exact thought in my dose titration, if they had just extended it even 2 months. I feel like I would have tolerated the 9 mg and 12 mg boxes better than I initially did. I work as a nurse practitioner so I prescribe these drugs all the time and I am much slower to titrate upwards with my patients than the trials, And generally my patients tolerate it a lot better because I do that.

One thing I didn't see in your post and even now it may be something to consider but have you taken probiotics at all? I found for me when I started having increasing side effects with the 4 mg box that a good probiotic really helped straighten out my GI tract. 

I do also love that you endorse taking the anti-nausea medicine because that has been a lifesaver for me, I only had to take a half a dozen doses of anti nausea meds but it really helped get through those higher doses. 

That said, I think your post also again shows the breadth of experiences as some of us have had many less side effects, and some of us have had more. I know for me my side effects have essentially disappeared now that I am in dose maintenance phase. In fact I go for my week 36 visit today and when I look at my side effect log for the last month, it is literally empty despite being on 12mg. I really hope that your side effects can wane too. 

I appreciate your in-depth post. Glad to hear you're having much less knee pain and I look forward to future updates from you!!",4.936615347862244
1d7p8au,RetatrutideTrial,Triumph 4 (Knee Osteoarthritis) – 24 week update,notyouroldlady,1717477582.0,"F55, SW82.6kg (182lb), CW 70.9kg (156lb), GW 68.5kg (151lb)

I’m roughly 6 months into the Retatrutide trial for arthritis of the knee.  This trial requires a starting BMI of 27 or more, as well as knee osteoarthritis of level 2 or 3 (out of a 4). There are three randomised groups – placebo, max dose 9mg & max dose 12mg. I’m pretty confident that I’m in the 12mg group. I’m not in the US.

I had my initial visit in late November and was randomised (received first dose of the meds) in mid-December. The appetite suppression started immediately. I’ve been losing ½ kg (1lb) every week pretty consistently. At 6 months in, I’m very close to my goal weight but I’m hoping to slow down the loss a little so that I can stay on the meds as long as possible, giving my body the best possible chance to accept my new weight as normal.

Now I’m going to talk about the side effects, of which I have suffered many.  However, if you are taking this medication outside of a trial, or are hoping to in the future, please remember that you will be taking a dose that is appropriate for you personally, whereas I am taking the dose based on the trial protocols. Under those circumstances, I imagine I would have titrated up more slowly and stayed at a lower dose. Also, I have had IBS all my life and it can be hard to separate IBS from Reta side effects. Here are the miseries I have suffered on my way to a healthy weight.

Constipation/diarrhoea – This started immediately from my first dose. I was pretty uncomfortable in the first week. Movicol helped.

Fire skin – The skin burning started in the early weeks.  At first I felt it mostly on my forearms, but it’s moved around my body since then. Now I mostly notice it when I’m cold and I get goosebumps.

Cold – The cold hit me at about 3 months in.  On the first day, I couldn’t stop shivering. My body temperature was down around 35C (95F). Once I started drinking electrolytes (I recommend LMNT or Thorzt), this got much better, but I am still colder in general than I used to be.

Sleep disturbances – This is worst in the early mornings. My stomach/bowel (whatever, I’m not a doctor) wakes up as early as 3am and I often can’t get back to sleep. This happens maybe twice a week and I think it’s related to when I’ve taken the med, on about day 2 or 3.

Racing heart rate – I’ve had a few times where my heart rate just goes nuts, up to 130 or so. And overall, my resting heart rate has increased from an average of 68 before the trial to currently 84. I don’t really notice this, and it doesn’t bother me.

Nausea/vomiting – This kicked in when I hit 9mg, so about 4 months into the trial. I had a very bad experience with overeating – trust me you don’t need the details.  For my first month on 12mg, I vomited constantly and really felt quite ill.  My loved ones worried about me.  When I went into the clinic, they were alarmed at how poorly I looked.  I suppose I hadn’t realised how bad it was. Anyway, they gave me anti-nausea meds which made a HUGE difference. I had Ondansetron, which was not very helpful, and metoclopramide (Maxalon) which was. I’m reliant on that now. When the Maxalon wears off, the nausea kicks in.

Dry mouth/bad breath – My mouth was dry for several months, although it seems to have eased a bit now. My partner commented one day that my breath smelled like camphor, and I Googled “mothball breath” to discover that it’s a real thing, and it’s to do with a bacterium that grows in a dry mouth. I did buy some mouthwash, but I have trouble using it because it makes me vomit.

Low blood pressure/dizziness – My BP tends toward low anyway, but I did have a few precipitous dips, and I’d get dizzy standing up. My job involves standing in front of people talking and I found myself having to drag over a chair. I manage this by trying to keep some food down and keeping up with the electrolytes.

Tiredness – I know some people talk about feeling energetic on Reta, but I have not. I’m generally a bit tired on it, but with all the disturbed sleep and vomiting, it could also be a side effect of the side effects. I’ve also just started taking a multivitamin.

The first month on (assumed) 12mg was very rough for me, and so the clinic had me take a week off at the start of the following month.  I’m also about to go on holidays (vacation) so I’m taking another two weeks off.  Apparently, it shouldn’t be a bit shock to go back on after that. Shortly after that I will likely hit BMI 22.5, and then I’ll have to deviate from the study protocols. They can put me back to 9mg or they might take me off completely, but I can stay in the trial to see the dietician and have regular health checks. I am very nervous about coming off the medication, but I’m increasing my exercise in the hope of building more muscle which will help keep my weight down in future.

But, I hear you ask, what about the arthritis? Well, I’m pleased to say that the reduction in pain and stiffness was slow to kick in, but now I’m delighted with the state of my knees. I’m much more mobile, I even slowly jogged about 100 metres a couple of days back. That was unimaginable 6 months ago.

Despite the misery, I am so happy to have lucked my way onto this trial. (I just happened to be seeing the trial doctor for another issue and he noticed the arthritis in my medical history.) I get quite emotional when I think about the millions of people who are going to be helped by this. ",l70vqyo,Mrs_Magic_Fairy_Dust,1717478959.0,Thanks for sharing your experience!,4.969241619110107

I am in the same trial. However I stopped taking the meds after two months (late October->late December). I had zero energy for the first few days after taking each shot. When I started my third box I ended up in bed for the better part of three days. I was done. I didn’t have time for that. I lost 17 lbs (165->148) and my knee pain diminished a lot. 
They are still tracking me. It was fine coming off the drug but after about a months my weight started creeping up. I went on oral semaglutide and that has helped a lot and I actually lost a couple pounds over two months. I have no side effects with it. 
Not sure where my weight is at the moment as I’ve been traveling for two weeks. It’s been great to have less knee pain as I tromp around Italy. Even better is almost no back pain! That was a bigger problem for me than the knee pain. 
I hope your experience continues to improve. These really are miracle drugs!",4.436485469341278

I’m roughly 6 months into the Retatrutide trial for arthritis of the knee.  This trial requires a starting BMI of 27 or more, as well as knee osteoarthritis of level 2 or 3 (out of a 4). There are three randomised groups – placebo, max dose 9mg & max dose 12mg. I’m pretty confident that I’m in the 12mg group. I’m not in the US.

I had my initial visit in late November and was randomised (received first dose of the meds) in mid-December. The appetite suppression started immediately. I’ve been losing ½ kg (1lb) every week pretty consistently. At 6 months in, I’m very close to my goal weight but I’m hoping to slow down the loss a little so that I can stay on the meds as long as possible, giving my body the best possible chance to accept my new weight as normal.

Now I’m going to talk about the side effects, of which I have suffered many.  However, if you are taking this medication outside of a trial, or are hoping to in the future, please remember that you will be taking a dose that is appropriate for you personally, whereas I am taking the dose based on the trial protocols. Under those circumstances, I imagine I would have titrated up more slowly and stayed at a lower dose. Also, I have had IBS all my life and it can be hard to separate IBS from Reta side effects. Here are the miseries I have suffered on my way to a healthy weight.

Constipation/diarrhoea – This started immediately from my first dose. I was pretty uncomfortable in the first week. Movicol helped.

Fire skin – The skin burning started in the early weeks.  At first I felt it mostly on my forearms, but it’s moved around my body since then. Now I mostly notice it when I’m cold and I get goosebumps.

Cold – The cold hit me at about 3 months in.  On the first day, I couldn’t stop shivering. My body temperature was down around 35C (95F). Once I started drinking electrolytes (I recommend LMNT or Thorzt), this got much better, but I am still colder in general than I used to be.

Sleep disturbances – This is worst in the early mornings. My stomach/bowel (whatever, I’m not a doctor) wakes up as early as 3am and I often can’t get back to sleep. This happens maybe twice a week and I think it’s related to when I’ve taken the med, on about day 2 or 3.

Racing heart rate – I’ve had a few times where my heart rate just goes nuts, up to 130 or so. And overall, my resting heart rate has increased from an average of 68 before the trial to currently 84. I don’t really notice this, and it doesn’t bother me.

Nausea/vomiting – This kicked in when I hit 9mg, so about 4 months into the trial. I had a very bad experience with overeating – trust me you don’t need the details.  For my first month on 12mg, I vomited constantly and really felt quite ill.  My loved ones worried about me.  When I went into the clinic, they were alarmed at how poorly I looked.  I suppose I hadn’t realised how bad it was. Anyway, they gave me anti-nausea meds which made a HUGE difference. I had Ondansetron, which was not very helpful, and metoclopramide (Maxalon) which was. I’m reliant on that now. When the Maxalon wears off, the nausea kicks in.

Dry mouth/bad breath – My mouth was dry for several months, although it seems to have eased a bit now. My partner commented one day that my breath smelled like camphor, and I Googled “mothball breath” to discover that it’s a real thing, and it’s to do with a bacterium that grows in a dry mouth. I did buy some mouthwash, but I have trouble using it because it makes me vomit.

Low blood pressure/dizziness – My BP tends toward low anyway, but I did have a few precipitous dips, and I’d get dizzy standing up. My job involves standing in front of people talking and I found myself having to drag over a chair. I manage this by trying to keep some food down and keeping up with the electrolytes.

Tiredness – I know some people talk about feeling energetic on Reta, but I have not. I’m generally a bit tired on it, but with all the disturbed sleep and vomiting, it could also be a side effect of the side effects. I’ve also just started taking a multivitamin.

The first month on (assumed) 12mg was very rough for me, and so the clinic had me take a week off at the start of the following month.  I’m also about to go on holidays (vacation) so I’m taking another two weeks off.  Apparently, it shouldn’t be a bit shock to go back on after that. Shortly after that I will likely hit BMI 22.5, and then I’ll have to deviate from the study protocols. They can put me back to 9mg or they might take me off completely, but I can stay in the trial to see the dietician and have regular health checks. I am very nervous about coming off the medication, but I’m increasing my exercise in the hope of building more muscle which will help keep my weight down in future.

But, I hear you ask, what about the arthritis? Well, I’m pleased to say that the reduction in pain and stiffness was slow to kick in, but now I’m delighted with the state of my knees. I’m much more mobile, I even slowly jogged about 100 metres a couple of days back. That was unimaginable 6 months ago.

Despite the misery, I am so happy to have lucked my way onto this trial. (I just happened to be seeing the trial doctor for another issue and he noticed the arthritis in my medical history.)

I’m much more mobile, I even slowly jogged about 100 metres a couple of days back. That was unimaginable 6 months ago.

Despite the misery, I am so happy to have lucked my way onto this trial. (I just happened to be seeing the trial doctor for another issue and he noticed the arthritis in my medical history.) I get quite emotional when I think about the millions of people who are going to be helped by this. ",l93f4ml,Lumpy_Code_4267,1718676232.0,Increase protein to 150 to 200 g per day.  And lift as heavy as possible. ,4.694394409656525
1d7p8au,RetatrutideTrial,Triumph 4 (Knee Osteoarthritis) – 24 week update,notyouroldlady,1717477582.0,"F55, SW82.6kg (182lb), CW 70.9kg (156lb), GW 68.5kg (151lb)

I’m roughly 6 months into the Retatrutide trial for arthritis of the knee.  This trial requires a starting BMI of 27 or more, as well as knee osteoarthritis of level 2 or 3 (out of a 4). There are three randomised groups – placebo, max dose 9mg & max dose 12mg. I’m pretty confident that I’m in the 12mg group. I’m not in the US.

I had my initial visit in late November and was randomised (received first dose of the meds) in mid-December. The appetite suppression started immediately. I’ve been losing ½ kg (1lb) every week pretty consistently. At 6 months in, I’m very close to my goal weight but I’m hoping to slow down the loss a little so that I can stay on the meds as long as possible, giving my body the best possible chance to accept my new weight as normal.

Now I’m going to talk about the side effects, of which I have suffered many.  However, if you are taking this medication outside of a trial, or are hoping to in the future, please remember that you will be taking a dose that is appropriate for you personally, whereas I am taking the dose based on the trial protocols. Under those circumstances, I imagine I would have titrated up more slowly and stayed at a lower dose. Also, I have had IBS all my life and it can be hard to separate IBS from Reta side effects. Here are the miseries I have suffered on my way to a healthy weight.

Constipation/diarrhoea – This started immediately from my first dose. I was pretty uncomfortable in the first week. Movicol helped.

Fire skin – The skin burning started in the early weeks.  At first I felt it mostly on my forearms, but it’s moved around my body since then. Now I mostly notice it when I’m cold and I get goosebumps.

Cold – The cold hit me at about 3 months in.  On the first day, I couldn’t stop shivering. My body temperature was down around 35C (95F). Once I started drinking electrolytes (I recommend LMNT or Thorzt), this got much better, but I am still colder in general than I used to be.

Sleep disturbances – This is worst in the early mornings. My stomach/bowel (whatever, I’m not a doctor) wakes up as early as 3am and I often can’t get back to sleep. This happens maybe twice a week and I think it’s related to when I’ve taken the med, on about day 2 or 3.

Racing heart rate – I’ve had a few times where my heart rate just goes nuts, up to 130 or so. And overall, my resting heart rate has increased from an average of 68 before the trial to currently 84. I don’t really notice this, and it doesn’t bother me.

Nausea/vomiting – This kicked in when I hit 9mg, so about 4 months into the trial. I had a very bad experience with overeating – trust me you don’t need the details.  For my first month on 12mg, I vomited constantly and really felt quite ill.  My loved ones worried about me.  When I went into the clinic, they were alarmed at how poorly I looked.  I suppose I hadn’t realised how bad it was. Anyway, they gave me anti-nausea meds which made a HUGE difference. I had Ondansetron, which was not very helpful, and metoclopramide (Maxalon) which was. I’m reliant on that now. When the Maxalon wears off, the nausea kicks in.

Dry mouth/bad breath – My mouth was dry for several months, although it seems to have eased a bit now. My partner commented one day that my breath smelled like camphor, and I Googled “mothball breath” to discover that it’s a real thing, and it’s to do with a bacterium that grows in a dry mouth. I did buy some mouthwash, but I have trouble using it because it makes me vomit.

Low blood pressure/dizziness – My BP tends toward low anyway, but I did have a few precipitous dips, and I’d get dizzy standing up. My job involves standing in front of people talking and I found myself having to drag over a chair. I manage this by trying to keep some food down and keeping up with the electrolytes.

Tiredness – I know some people talk about feeling energetic on Reta, but I have not. I’m generally a bit tired on it, but with all the disturbed sleep and vomiting, it could also be a side effect of the side effects. I’ve also just started taking a multivitamin.

The first month on (assumed) 12mg was very rough for me, and so the clinic had me take a week off at the start of the following month.  I’m also about to go on holidays (vacation) so I’m taking another two weeks off.  Apparently, it shouldn’t be a bit shock to go back on after that. Shortly after that I will likely hit BMI 22.5, and then I’ll have to deviate from the study protocols. They can put me back to 9mg or they might take me off completely, but I can stay in the trial to see the dietician and have regular health checks. I am very nervous about coming off the medication, but I’m increasing my exercise in the hope of building more muscle which will help keep my weight down in future.

What a ride this has been thus far. Less than a third of the way through and I’ve blown past my goals. My BP is normal, fully unmedicated and I’m back to being a picture of health (at least on paper). As far as what dose I’m on, I believe either 9mg or 12mg (leaning towards 12 but I waver). It was smooth sailing for the first few months honestly. Just steady loss and mild side effects. The last escalation, however, was a STRUGGLE. I had significant nausea and was wholly uninterested in food for almost a month. This led to extremely low energy levels and eventually brain fog. I also realized that I was dealing with acid reflux for months and thought it was nausea 🙃. After those 3-4 weeks though, my apathy towards food and my other new and major side effects subsided. My RHR which was a major indication of being on the meds for me has leveled out around 72-77 bpm which is a solid 20ish bpm increase. So there’s that. 

I know this may be frowned upon but I also skipped a week for a trip to Japan. This was shortly after the food apathy episode. It was approved by my trial staff and I have no regrets. I had no trouble continuing upon my return. 

Another thing I’ve noticed is that the scale fluctuates quite a bit. Especially these days. I’m not sure if it’s a result of dehydration or just the nature of this medication. It’s fine by me as I don’t have a goal weight anyway. 

Going forward, my focus is going to be on building muscle, eating more, and increasing my water intake. I’m still working my way back up to 2-4L/day, it’s been difficult.

What a ride this has been thus far. Less than a third of the way through and I’ve blown past my goals. My BP is normal, fully unmedicated and I’m back to being a picture of health (at least on paper). As far as what dose I’m on, I believe either 9mg or 12mg (leaning towards 12 but I waver). It was smooth sailing for the first few months honestly. Just steady loss and mild side effects. The last escalation, however, was a STRUGGLE. I had significant nausea and was wholly uninterested in food for almost a month. This led to extremely low energy levels and eventually brain fog. I also realized that I was dealing with acid reflux for months and thought it was nausea 🙃. After those 3-4 weeks though, my apathy towards food and my other new and major side effects subsided. My RHR which was a major indication of being on the meds for me has leveled out around 72-77 bpm which is a solid 20ish bpm increase. So there’s that. 

I know this may be frowned upon but I also skipped a week for a trip to Japan. This was shortly after the food apathy episode. It was approved by my trial staff and I have no regrets. I had no trouble continuing upon my return.

",l54g7n8,Nenabobena,1716350158.0,"I’m on the fence on this debate, but it’s unfair that Clintrial is getting downvoted. I’m very concerned about access to the compound versions of the GLP1s because they are being administered at Spas and cosmetic clinics without any medical care or counseling. I don’t like to use anecdotal evidence to make my point but two close relatives received Semaglutide shots from a spa and one of them had to have an emergency gall bladder removal and the other one is currently at the hospital with kidney infection and kidney stones. They are both healthy people that only wanted to lose around 30 lbs for looks, neither was in the obese range. 
I’ve read extensively about glp-associated gall bladder removal and kidney stones, and so far they both seem to be related to high fat diets and dehydration, which leads me to believe that folks are not receiving any counseling about avoiding high-fat foods and the importance of staying well hydrated while on these meds. 
I think the Australian government is seeing this and trying to stop it right away to avoid more harm.",4.792662620544434

GW 165

I'm in the Triumph 1 trial for weightloss and Osteoarthritis. I'm a female and 55. I just took my 2nd injection yesterday and have lost only a 1lb so far. I've had some digestive issues, hot and cold issues,  and migraines the day after the injection but that's it. I still get some hunger noise but I'm not a big eater so that was never that much of an issue for me. 
I'm just wondering if this is average or do you think I may have gotten the placebo? If you think it's too early to know either way, please let me know as well. 
I tried the Tirzepatide compound last year and lost some weight before it got too expensive to continue. I'm a little nervous bc there is no burning sensation when injected and I have a lot less symptoms on retatrutide than I experienced while on tirzepatide.  
Love to hear your thoughts, experiences and advice this early into the study. Thanks!",l4peclz,okiejay1,1716101717.0,"I have read that it starts at 4 mg.

He’s down 60 pounds so far.  He’s only had two side effects to speak of.  First is constipation which he controls with Miralax every other day.  Second is the “chills” every night.  He’s never been a cold person, but he is now!  From my perspective it’s great because he now turns the heat up, when I would normally be freezing and he’d be hot.  After 20 years of marriage we have the same thermostat!

There are things I notice that he probably doesn’t.  He has more energy, he walks faster, including going up and down the stairs.  He’s now taking his BP med every other day.  He’s had great progress.

",l454xfc,atlhart,1715773284.0,"I’m much farther along in the trial. Regarding chills, I highly recommend your husband start drinking some electrolytes a few times a week, if not every other day.

I was incredibly cold, especially in my hands/feet. At the same time my blood pressure had dropped to the low end of the healthy range. Since starting to drink electrolytes regularly, I’m *much* better. 

I drink unsweetened/unflavored Gatorlyte packets, but anything will do. There are tons out there: LMNT, liquid IV, Prime, regular Gatorade/powerade (sugar free), on and on.

I opted for unflavored/unsweetened because being on the drug I just don’t enjoy sweet things. The Gatorlyte makes water kind of salty tasting, which is odd at first but now I love it. 

All that being said, this will make it better but not go completely away. It’ll get better once he reaches a maintenance phase and starts to level off his weightloss. In the meantime I also recommend some good wool socks :).",4.609476804733276

I 100% could have done better. During the ramp up phase my appetite was so suppressed, and I got so full so quickly, I could not eat 100g, much less 150g, of protein. Trying to get your protein in was a double edged sword. I needed a lot of protein to maintain muscle mass, but the more protein I ate the faster I felt full and longer I felt full. So the closer I’d get to 75-100g the harder it was to eat another gram of protein. 

Additionally, I slacked off in the gym once I started seeing such non-gym results. I’ve lost 55 lbs dropping from 230 to 175. All of my lifts suffered, but my bench press disproportionately was effect. I was pushing 5x5 @205 lbs and now I’m at 5x5@135 lbs. The rest of my lifts saw about a 25% decrease.

I should have done better. But I think some muscle mass is unavoidable at the rate people are dropping.",4.742654263973236

In Oz 🇦🇺, Each four week block it goes up, 2mg, 4mg, 6mg, 9mg (option 1stays on this) or option 2 goes up to 12mg

If at any stage, if have side effects, they can keep you at the current dose or if the effects are unmanageable they can move you down only one level. But they only keep you at the same level for two blocks of 4weeks.

By what you have described, your body might have just got use to the medication or maxing out. Remember, the means average % total body loss on 12mg at 24weeks is 17%. At 48week the total body loss average is roughly 23%. This is the average, some are higher & some are just lower. You could just be on the lower side.

It is curious to me that previous clinical trial reporting defined non-responders as ""\[Those who\] didn’t lose 5% or more of their body weight within the first three months of treatment."" That means that a 200-pound participant could lose 9-10 pounds in the first three months but still be defined as not responding?

",l18sdnk,RunningFNP,1714074379.0,"Part of that 5% thing is the FDA bar they have to clear for weight loss drugs.

I’m one of the earliest participants in my trial so they haven’t had to do it yet, but they said at BMI 22.5 they reduce the dose. If you reach BMI 18.5, you have to stop taking the meds.

There's not a pattern or the same issue repeating, it's a lot of random issues that probably would exist in any random sample of 300 people with known health issues. After 7 months I'm the trial they've done numerous EKGs on me and they've all been normal. 

Moreover we know that glucagon is both inotropic and chronotropic. In laymen's terms it increases your heart rate and increases the force/strength at which your heart beats. 

Anyways, don't be put off by that aspect of it. On a personal note it has increased my resting heart rate, I used to be 57-58BPM for years and years on my Garmin watch. With retatrutide it's now 64-65BPM. So a very small increase in resting heart rate and thats it! In exchange I've lost over 65 pounds now and I'm healthier than I've ever been in my adult life.

I’m in Canada. Tried mounjaro when it came out here and it worked great but shortly after starting supply dried up and hated the mounjaro hunger games in addition to not being covered by insurance so it was short lived.

Make sure you’re eating enough protein! You’re going to lose some major muscle mass at that rate if you aren’t. 

Some people say to eat TWICE the normal amount of protein. So like 1.6 g to 2.0 g of protein per kg of lean body mass. I couldn’t do that, just couldn’t eat that much. But try. Really prioritize protein.

If you start to feel cold, start drinking electrolytes. I drink an electrolyte mix 2-3 times a week now. A lot of people get cold a few months in. I did. But not since I started electrolytes. 

And don’t forget to drink water. It’s really easy to forget.",4.842448353767395

However those first couple months had some rough patches. The 3rd month I had what you're describing. Multiple days of diarrhea. 

Things that helped me: Probiotics. Protonix OR Pepcid. Immodium.

Also avoided anything spicy/greasy/fatty/overly acidic/extra starchy. That eliminated alot of the issue. 

Now a word of caution. Do not go popping the Immodium daily. I took it after that first loose 💩 and only took one per day and never more than that.

Just know it can cause constipation, which is prob a good thing in your current situation. The low- to mid-grade nausea can be remedied with over-the-counter chewable tabs from Emetrol or Nauzene (same thing; buy whichever one you find).

🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️ Sorry you are on the struggle bus with the runs. Here’s some [advice from MD Anderson](https://www.mdanderson.org/patient-education/Bowel-Management/Diarrhea.pdf), which may treat cancer patients but also knows a heck of a lot about [bowel management issues](https://www.mdanderson.org/patients-family/diagnosis-treatment/emotional-physical-effects/bowel-management.html) for those on medications:

**Solutions to Help Slow Your Stools**

- Take Imodium or Lomotil at the time your medical team suggests.

- Take medicinal fiber, such as psyllium (Metamucil®) or methylcellulose (Citrucel®). The
fiber absorbs excess fluid like a sponge. Do not drink liquids for 1 hour after taking medicinal fiber. When you take the right amount of psyllium, other medicines may not be needed. As you increase the dose of psyllium, decrease the dose of Imodium or Lomotil.

Hope that helps! And here’s hoping this is just all temporary for you.",4.68468701839447

",kuo64vn,atlhart,1710335226.0,"That’s really great! My stats are very similar to your own, so I know it has to feel good to be in a smaller body. My weight loss is hovering at around 54 pounds, but I broke the BMI chart a long time ago with weight lifting so technically my BMI is still 26.4.

I’ve more or less been in maintenance for three weeks now. Mentally, it’s tough not seeing the scale to go down anymore. I’m thrilled with my current weight. It’s 5 pounds below my goal weight. But I’m so used to waking up in the morning and seeing the number on the scale, being a little lower every day or two. 

My goal for the next year is to achieve some body recomp. I am mentally not comfortable with engaging in a bolt/cut cycle, and I’m not even sure I’d want to try to eat at a surplus while on this medication, but a body Recomp to increase muscle mass slowly over time seems very achievable.

My current concern now is how I’m going to handle the loss of that glucagon metabolic affect a year from now. I’m very comfortable with the amount of food. I’m eating now and maintenance. I read once that in the rodent studies they attributed 30% of the weight loss to the metabolic affect. If that translates to humans, that’s extremely significant and losing that at the end of the trial will really impact my maintenance calories.",4.868993520736694
